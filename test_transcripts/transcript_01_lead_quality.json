  "transcript_text": "Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling IndiaMART Seller Support. My name is Priya. How may I assist you today? Seller: Hello Priya, my name is Rajesh Sharma. I am calling from Sharma Electronics in Pune. I have been your premium customer for 3 years now and I need to discuss several issues with my account. Agent: Good morning Mr. Sharma. Thank you for being a valued premium member. I can see your account here - Seller ID MH78234. You have the Gold TrustSEAL package with priority listing. How can I help you today? Seller: Priya, let me be very honest with you. I am extremely frustrated with the lead quality I have been receiving lately. I run an electronics distribution business and I pay Rs 35000 per month for your premium services. But the returns are becoming very poor. Agent: I am sorry to hear that sir. Can you tell me more about the specific issues you are facing with leads? Seller: Look, last month I received 247 leads through IndiaMART. Out of these, I personally called each one. Do you know how many were genuine buyers? Only 31! That means barely 12 percent conversion. The rest were either competitors fishing for my prices, students doing college projects, or people who had no intention of buying. Agent: That conversion rate is indeed concerning sir. Let me check your lead analytics. I can see that your primary categories are Industrial Electrical Components and MCB Panels. These are competitive categories. Are you using our Buyer Verification filters? Seller: What filters? I have been paying premium for 3 years and nobody told me about any filters. This is the problem with IndiaMART - you keep adding features but never inform existing customers. We only find out when we call to complain. Agent: I sincerely apologize for that sir. We do have a Lead Quality Score feature that was introduced 6 months ago. It uses AI to score each lead from 1 to 10 based on buyer behavior, verification status, and inquiry patterns. You can set a threshold to only receive leads above a certain score. Seller: Okay that sounds useful. But why was this not enabled by default for premium customers? And why did my relationship manager not inform me? I have not heard from Vikram in 4 months. Agent: Let me check that sir. I see that your previous relationship manager Vikram was reassigned in August. A new RM should have been assigned but I see there is a gap here. I apologize for this oversight. I will personally ensure a senior RM contacts you within 24 hours. Seller: Please do that. Now let me tell you about another problem. My product visibility has dropped significantly. Earlier when someone searched for MCB Panel Manufacturer in Pune, my listing was always in the top 5. Now I am on page 2 or 3. What happened? Agent: Let me analyze your visibility metrics sir. I can see a few factors affecting your ranking. First, your catalog has 89 products but 34 of them have not been updated in over 90 days. The algorithm favors fresh and complete listings. Second, your response time to inquiries has increased from 2 hours to 8 hours average. Third, there are 12 new verified sellers in your category in Pune region who are actively optimizing their profiles. Seller: But Priya, I told you - I am spending 8 hours responding to fake leads! Of course my response time will suffer. And how can I update catalog when I am busy chasing useless inquiries? This is a vicious cycle your platform has created. Agent: You raise a very valid point sir and I understand the frustration. Here is what I suggest - let me immediately enable the Lead Quality filters with a threshold of 6 out of 10. This should reduce your junk leads by approximately 60 percent based on our data. This will free up your time to focus on genuine buyers and catalog updates. Seller: Fine, please do that. But I want some compensation for the 3 years I have wasted on fake leads. I estimate I have lost at least 500 hours dealing with spam inquiries. Agent: I understand sir. While I cannot compensate for past time, I can offer you a 3-month extension on your current package at no additional cost. I will also arrange for our Catalog Optimization team to update your top 50 products with enhanced descriptions and better images. This is a service that normally costs Rs 15000. Seller: That sounds fair. Now tell me about one more thing. I have been hearing about IndiaMART's new B2B marketplace integration. What is that about? Agent: Great question sir! We have recently launched integration with major B2B platforms including Amazon Business and Flipkart Wholesale. If you opt in, your verified products can be listed on these platforms as well, expanding your reach significantly. For Gold TrustSEAL members, we offer this at a 40 percent discount. Seller: Interesting. What is the cost and what kind of results can I expect? Agent: The integration package starts at Rs 8000 per month. Based on sellers in similar categories, we have seen an average 35 percent increase in qualified leads. I can send you detailed case studies and ROI projections to your email. Seller: Yes please send that. Also, I want to mention that my competitor Gupta Electricals seems to be getting much better placement than me. I know for a fact their products are inferior. How is this fair? Agent: Sir, I cannot comment on other sellers' accounts due to privacy policies. However, I can tell you that ranking depends on multiple factors including catalog completeness, response rates, buyer reviews, and engagement metrics. If you suspect any unfair practices, you can file a formal complaint through our Seller Grievance portal and our team will investigate. Seller: Fine, I will consider that. One last thing - I need to update my GST details as I have added a new branch in Mumbai. How do I do that? Agent: For GST updates, you will need to upload the new GST certificate through your Seller Dashboard under Business Documents section. Alternatively, I can initiate a verification request right now and our team will call you within 48 hours to complete the process. Shall I do that? Seller: Yes please initiate that. And Priya, I appreciate your help today. You have been more useful in this one call than my relationship manager has been in 4 months. Please make sure all these actions are taken. Agent: Thank you for your kind words sir. Let me summarize what we have discussed and the actions I will take. First, enabling Lead Quality filters with threshold 6. Second, 3-month free extension on your package. Third, free catalog optimization for 50 products. Fourth, new relationship manager assignment within 24 hours. Fifth, sending B2B integration details to your email. Sixth, initiating GST verification for Mumbai branch. Is there anything else I can help you with? Seller: No that covers everything. Thank you Priya. Agent: Thank you for calling Mr. Sharma. We value your 3 years of partnership and I will personally follow up to ensure all these actions are completed. You will receive a confirmation email within 2 hours. Have a wonderful day sir. Seller: Thank you. Goodbye. Agent: Goodbye sir."
