  "transcript_text": "Agent: Thank you for calling IndiaMART Premium Seller Support. This is Mohit speaking. How can I help you today? Seller: Hello Mohit, I am Sunita Agarwal from Delhi. I run Agarwal Textiles and I am a platinum member. I wanted to discuss my renewal which is coming up next month and also some concerns about the platform. Agent: Good morning Mrs. Agarwal. Welcome back. I can see you have been with us for 5 years with Platinum TrustSEAL. Your renewal is due on January 15th. Thank you for being such a loyal customer. What would you like to discuss? Seller: Mohit, first let me tell you about my experience. When I joined IndiaMART 5 years ago, my textile business was doing maybe 50 lakhs annual revenue from online inquiries. Today it has grown to 2.3 crores. So I am very grateful for the platform. Agent: That is wonderful to hear Mrs. Agarwal! A 360 percent growth in 5 years is remarkable. We are proud to have contributed to your success. Seller: Yes but Mohit, I have to be honest. The last one year has been challenging. I feel the platform is becoming too crowded. When I started, there were maybe 200 textile suppliers in my category in Delhi NCR. Now there are over 2000. How am I supposed to stand out? Agent: You raise a valid concern ma'am. The B2B marketplace has indeed become more competitive. However, with competition comes more buyers too. Our platform traffic has increased 4x in the same period. The key is differentiation. Can you tell me what unique value your business offers? Seller: We specialize in handloom and organic cotton textiles. We work directly with weavers from Varanasi and Bhagalpur. Our products are authentic and we have all certifications - Handloom Mark, Organic certification, GI tags for certain products. But buyers cannot easily find these differentiators on the platform. Agent: That is excellent positioning ma'am! You have genuine differentiators. Let me suggest something - have you explored our Premium Storefront feature? It allows you to create a branded mini-website within IndiaMART showcasing your story, certifications, and unique value proposition. Seller: I have seen that but it seems complicated to set up. And honestly, I do not have time to learn new features. My team is small - just me, my husband, and two helpers. Agent: I completely understand ma'am. For valued platinum members like yourself, we offer complimentary storefront setup service. Our team will work with you over 2-3 calls to create a professional storefront. We will highlight your certifications, add your brand story, and create a visual catalog. This typically improves inquiry quality by 40 percent. Seller: That sounds helpful. Please arrange that. But I have another concern. I keep getting calls from your sales team trying to sell me additional services. Last week someone called me 4 times in one day! I am already platinum member, what more do you want to sell? Agent: I sincerely apologize for that ma'am. That should not happen to existing premium members. Can you give me the dates and times of these calls? I will report this to our quality team and ensure your number is added to the do-not-disturb list for sales calls. Seller: I don't remember exact times but it was very annoying. Also, they were trying to sell me something called MaxLeads or something. What is that? Agent: MaxLeads is our pay-per-lead service where you can purchase additional verified leads beyond your package quota. However, as a platinum member with unlimited leads, you should not be getting these calls. I am flagging this as a process issue right now. Seller: Good. Now tell me about my renewal. My current package is Rs 72000 per year. I saw on the website that prices have increased. What will my renewal cost? Agent: Mrs. Agarwal, for loyal platinum members like yourself, we have special retention pricing. Your renewal will be Rs 75000, which is only a 4 percent increase despite our standard prices going up 15 percent. Additionally, I can offer you our new Video Catalog feature free for one year - this is normally Rs 12000. Seller: What is Video Catalog? Agent: Video Catalog allows you to add 30-second product videos to your listings. For textiles, this is very powerful because buyers can see the fabric texture, drape, and colors much better than photos. Sellers using video have 60 percent higher engagement rates. Seller: That does sound useful for textiles. But I am not sure how to make videos. Agent: We provide simple guidelines and our team can even help you create the first 10 videos remotely. You just need a smartphone with good camera. We guide you on lighting, angles, and what to show. Many of our textile sellers have found this very effective. Seller: Okay include that in my renewal. Now I want to discuss something serious. Last month I had a very bad experience with a buyer who turned out to be a fraud. They placed a large order worth Rs 3.5 lakhs, we shipped the goods, and then they disputed the payment claiming goods were not as described. I lost the entire amount. Agent: I am very sorry to hear that ma'am. That is a terrible experience. Can you tell me more about how this transaction happened? Seller: They contacted through IndiaMART, we had several conversations, they seemed genuine. They even visited my warehouse once. Then they placed the order, paid 30 percent advance through your payment gateway, and we shipped. After delivery they raised a dispute saying the fabric quality was different from samples. But I have proof that we sent exactly what was agreed. Agent: Mrs. Agarwal, this is exactly why we recommend using IndiaMART's full payment protection for large orders. The 30 percent advance through our gateway was good, but for the remaining 70 percent, if you had used our escrow service, you would have been protected. Did you file a dispute with our Trust and Safety team? Seller: I did not know about escrow service. And yes I filed dispute but your team said since 70 percent payment was outside platform, they cannot help. This is not fair. I found the buyer through your platform. Agent: I understand your frustration ma'am. While we cannot recover payments made outside the platform, I can do a few things. First, I will have our Trust team review the buyer's account - if they have a pattern of such behavior, they will be blacklisted. Second, I will arrange a call with our seller protection advisor who can guide you on legal options. Third, for your renewal, I will add our Buyer Verification Premium service free - this gives you detailed background reports on potential buyers before you transact. Seller: That background report would have helped. Why is this not default for platinum members? Agent: Valid point ma'am. I will pass this feedback to our product team. The buyer verification reports require additional verification processes and have cost implications, but your feedback about making it default for premium members is valuable. Seller: Okay. I also wanted to ask - what is happening with IndiaMART's mobile app? It keeps crashing on my phone and the interface is very confusing. I am not very tech-savvy and I find it hard to navigate. Agent: Thank you for that feedback ma'am. We released a major app update last month which some users have found different from the old interface. Would you be interested in a personalized app training session? We can arrange a 30-minute video call where our support executive walks you through all the features step by step. Seller: Yes that would be helpful. I am 52 years old and these new apps confuse me. Agent: Absolutely understandable ma'am. Technology should make things easier, not harder. I am scheduling a training session for you. Someone from our team will call you within 3 days to fix a convenient time. They will also help you set up any features you are not using currently. Seller: Good. One more thing - I want to add my daughter to my account. She is helping me with the business now and should be able to respond to inquiries. Can we have two logins? Agent: Yes ma'am! We have a Team Access feature specifically for this. You can add up to 3 team members with different permission levels - Admin, Manager, or Executive. Your daughter can have her own login and respond to inquiries, update catalog, etc. I can enable this for you right now if you share her email address. Seller: Her email is priya.agarwal@gmail.com. Please add her as Manager level. Agent: Done ma'am. Priya will receive an invitation email within the next hour. She will need to set her own password and complete a brief verification. Once she is set up, you can both manage the account simultaneously. Seller: Perfect. I think that covers everything. Let me confirm - my renewal is Rs 75000 with video catalog free, you are setting up premium storefront, adding buyer verification service, arranging app training, and adding my daughter to the account. Correct? Agent: Absolutely correct ma'am. I will also ensure no more sales calls bother you, and I am flagging the fraud buyer case for review. You will receive a detailed email summary within 2 hours. The renewal invoice will be sent on January 1st with all the additional services included. Is there anything else? Seller: No Mohit, you have been very helpful. Much better than the last time I called when I was kept on hold for 20 minutes. Agent: I apologize for that past experience ma'am. We have significantly improved our premium support queue. As a platinum member, you now have access to priority callback - if you ever face hold times, just request a callback and we will call you back within 10 minutes. Seller: Good to know. Thank you Mohit. Agent: Thank you Mrs. Agarwal for your continued trust in IndiaMART. We look forward to supporting your business growth for many more years. Have a wonderful day ma'am. Seller: Thank you. Bye. Agent: Goodbye ma'am."
