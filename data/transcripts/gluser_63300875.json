  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hello? Ha hello. Oriaba Motors Private Limited?\\nCustomer: Ha bol rahe hain.\\nExecutive: Ha hi good morning. This is Pallavi from IndiaMART. How are you?\\nCustomer: I am doing good. Thanks. Aap kaise hain?\\nExecutive: Um, so I think you have sent me email that you said I am getting lot of leads but you only want to focus in the Orissa location.\\nCustomer: Correct, correct.\\nExecutive: So I think there is an option of the location. You can select the location Orissa as a my state and you can choose the location I lead.\\nCustomer: Yeah, I don't want to see any ads or anything other than Orissa.\\nExecutive: Sir, all the leads of other locations will be hidden. The moment you select the location Orissa, so they are all Orissa leads.\\nCustomer: I am onboarding, they gave me a choice whether they want to keep it Pan India or only to the location. Correct. Yeah, yeah. So, uh, so what is happening is the leads are also getting added from other states. Okay. We have added leads soon I went check the leads it was from a different state. Okay. So even if a fraction of second I am spending on it to check whether it's belong to me or not, right? It's a waste of my time. Right?\\nExecutive: Sir, if you don't have a feature I cannot say anything but because at that time they told that they can limit the ads to a particular state if I want. I don't want to see any other end anyway.\\nExecutive: I got your point sir. It is just that the you know the system shows the nearby location by lead so it it will recommend of Uttar Pradesh and it will be on the watch list.\\nCustomer: The problem is I don't want to, I cannot do anything in nearby states. It's a reach of area. Okay, further area.\\nCustomer: Okay, so how each day each time I log in I spend some time for ads. Sometime even the states are also not visible. Okay. It's it's somehow wasting my time. That's what I realized.\\nExecutive: Okay. So you have I think you have taken the services last last month in the month of October, right?\\nCustomer: Correct, correct.\\nExecutive: Right. But I see there is there is scope of like adding the products in your catalog. So what if if we give you you know inquiry and buyleads of silent diesel generator, will it be okay for you?\\nCustomer: Yeah.\\nExecutive: You you deal in silent diesel generator, right?\\nCustomer: Uh, two deal, two items are there.

And apart from this you deal in Kirloskar diesel generator, right?\\nCustomer: Correct, correct, right.\\nExecutive: So I am giving you the option if we add silent diesel generator, so it will recommend you Orissa you know whosoever is there any requirement for any other brand for silent diesel generator?\\nCustomer: No, no, no, no, no. It's yeah, it's a problem now. I cannot sell in my nearby district also. You need to be reachable to me or something or somebody might want to buy it. This video is the complaint. Okay. I I didn't know that. I was thinking that if my if somebody is border to my area why can't he buy it, okay? But later there were escalations, complaints, okay. So that's the reason I decided it's better for me, okay, if we limit to Orissa, that's what I told. Yeah, yeah, right.\\nExecutive: So I have just one question sir. That's the problem.\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's what that's what my question is sir. Are you dealing in like complete state of Orissa or in like some districts of Orissa?\\nCustomer: So it is some districts of Orissa relevant district we are covering but that's not issue, okay?

There is a state you can cover.\\nCustomer: I can deal with Orissa. Correct. State is fine.\\nExecutive: My question is sir, my question is let's suppose there is a buyer is looking for Mahindra silent diesel generator, okay?\\nCustomer: Uh huh, uh huh.\\nExecutive: And that lead is showing on the portal. Would you be interested in taking that lead?\\nCustomer: Yes, yes, fine.\\nExecutive: Okay. So like I will be adding some generic keywords like silent diesel generator. The moment I put silent diesel generator if there is any requirement of other brands Mahindra or Siemens or any any brand is there but the product is silent diesel generator it will show on your panel. So I am giving you the option to choose from the other brand also.\\nCustomer: Uh huh.\\nExecutive: Yeah, fine, fine. So so in that case you start getting the options in Orissa of your product. So this this will somehow solve your problem. What's my point sir?\\nCustomer: Yeah, but I lose I should not lose I share related or any bus truck related.\\nExecutive: No, no, no, not at all sir.

I share bus truck that also I should not lose, right?\\nExecutive: No, yeah, yeah, sir. I'm saying we sir is your first priority. I'm giving in the second priority of other brands.\\nCustomer: Sure, sure, sure. Okay, okay.\\nExecutive: You can choose from there. So it will be easy for you. But will it stop me adding leads of outside Orissa? Because I see emails like there is a Rajasthan getting emails.\\nExecutive: My page is having two options. You select India and you select Orissa. The moment you will select Orissa, my page gives to the options of Orissa and then below that if there is only two leads of Orissa on the third option it just recommends gives the recommendation of other states. The page cannot be blank. The page cannot be blank. It just gives the third option of other states because I am only having the two leads of Orissa.
