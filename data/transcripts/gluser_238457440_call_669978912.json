Latheetha I am telling you I am seeing your product line I see there is like good business opportunity over IndiaMART and if you devote some time and if we coordinate parallelly I am sure like you can understand IndiaMART is a public listed company we are a profitable company and we have like gained good business. So if you like obviously I mean business is all about ups and down and I cannot commit you that yes within three months or within four months you will definitely get the business. Our job we are a matchmaking platform and our job is to create a platform where we can do this matchmaking of the right right buyer with the right seller. This is our job right and we can because conversion is not in our business is also not in our end we are responsible to provide you relevant by leads and this is what we will be working from here onwards.\\nCustomer: Sir I got it all but the problem is like my mom doesn't know English. So she cannot come doesn't know English or Hindi so she cannot communicate with the the people other than like Kerala. So it is a huge problem for her. That's the problem we like back off backing off yeah.\\nExecutive: We will have to find out some solution. Like you have already provided your number going forward my team will be and I I would suggest let's do one thing Latheetha let's do one thing. Can you come over a video meeting tomorrow?\\nCustomer: I am working you know I am working from 9 to 8. So that I don't have that much yeah 9 to 8. So that I don't have that much time for that that's the problem you know. I understand all the things you have said or like you know you convey but the problem is she cannot understand Hindi or English or any other language so that it is so difficult for her. That's the problem. Like dealing with people is so difficult like only mean if we deal with people you know there will be sale only you know. You have to communicate we have to like motivate our like divert them to them into our business you know. She cannot do that. It will be a language barrier that's the problem.\\nExecutive: So so I understand let's let's do one thing Latheetha let's do one thing. Let us try to coordinate I mean my we will do one thing we will be sharing you some by leads over WhatsApp we will create a group where you don't need to connect with every buyer we will be sending you some set of by leads where you can connect from your end whenever you get the time okay and I am sure even if we follow that you will see the I won't say the conversion will happen or I cannot guarantee that but I am sure wherever we are as of now we will be in a better position for sure.\\nCustomer: Sir can I call you back after 10 minutes? I am in urgent situation. 10 minutes 10 minutes I will call. 10 minutes. I am in police station actually.
