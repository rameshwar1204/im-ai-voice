  "transcript": "Customer: Hello\\nExecutive: Hello sir?\\nCustomer: Yes.\\nExecutive: Sir, I am Swathi calling from IndiaMART team.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: So, we were discussing about the complaint, right? They have sent you a screenshot. Did you check it, sir?\\nCustomer: I saw it.\\nExecutive: Have you seen it?\\nCustomer: Yes.\\nExecutive: One minute sir.\\n\\nExecutive: Hello?\\nCustomer: Yes, hello.\\nExecutive: Sir, good evening sir. Priya here from IndiaMART. Sir, our sir was talking to you, right? About our login issue.\\nCustomer: IndiaMART, sir.\\nCustomer: Correct, which sir was talking, I don't understand.\\nExecutive: Sir, Rajesh sir was discussing with you. In that, we were following all the mail details to the back end team.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: So, they have given you the trade alert for that.\\nExecutive: I had sent you that as a screenshot. Did you see it?\\nCustomer: I saw it.\\nExecutive: Yeah, exactly sir. So, in that, we are not putting OTP. You are trying to log in without OTP. This has happened only with one IP address, sir. No other IP address has gone to it.\\nCustomer: Tell me simply, whose fault is this?\\nExecutive: That is, sir, there is no try for that login anywhere else. Whether you have used it through our system or mobile app, without you would have tried to log in, log in to our login, but you would not have put any OTP. At the same timing, whatever you have searched and inquired in IndiaMART, it has been posted in off login. That is the update.\\nCustomer: This is a wrong update.\\nExecutive: The back end team has given it, that is what we are sharing with you, sir.\\nCustomer: This is a wrong update. I know whether I have opened it or not. How are you deciding that I have opened it and seen it?\\nCustomer: How can you decide?\\nCustomer: You don't have login ID, you don't have access, you don't know when to go inside. Then how did you decide that we have gone inside and searched, everything else is correct?\\nCustomer: You have no evidence. How can you just like that say that we have gone inside and seen it?\\nExecutive: I am not saying that you have seen it, sir. Single IP address.\\nCustomer: There is nothing in the screenshot to reply to. That is why I did not reply.\\nCustomer: You are still in the same statement. Without any kind of valid information, you are still arguing on the same point.\\nExecutive: Sir, hello. Pardon sir.\\nCustomer: I am asking you, if I have logged in, is there any point in me discussing with you guys?\\nExecutive: Right sir, as a precautionary measure, we are asking you.\\nCustomer: That is why we are asking you. When a question is asked, how will it be if the same question is posted back to the person who is asking?\\nExecutive: Sir, what kind of update is there in our back end?\\nCustomer: Answer my question. If we are logging in and seeing, then what is the point in us discussing with you, sending mails, updating, what is the point in answering all the questions you are asking, we don't have any other work?\\nCustomer: Hello, it is nothing relevant to us at all. If there is something related to our business or our nature of work, we can understand. It is not related to our work, you are saying that you have searched, you have searched, we have not done anything, how will it be?\\nCustomer: Have they done any containment action or not? Why all this gossip?\\nExecutive: Okay, so no sir, if there are two IP addresses, it is showing to us, right sir? That is why.\\nCustomer: Two IP addresses?\\nExecutive: No sir, in a different module, it has logged in in another place also. If there is any proof for that, it is updated to us, sir. That is why.\\nCustomer: I am only saying, my system is my personal system, okay. Only if I log in, it can be opened, no one else can open it. In this system, in my system, only if I put OTP, IndiaMART will log in.\\nExecutive: Sir, without OTP, it is not happening, sir. Without updating OTP, it is not happening.\\nCustomer: In my Google browser, in Google Chrome, I have bookmarked IndiaMART. Even for that, I have to put OTP to go inside. Then who else will access it?\\nExecutive: Sir, yes. If you read the last line in the screenshot that I sent you, if you read it clearly, the requirement was posted from the same IP address under off login mode, which doesn't require OTP verification as per the.\\nCustomer: When I don't have that requirement, I don't have that requirement, you are asking the same question again, what is the meaning in that?\\nExecutive: Sir, now you have given this statement, we will update it to you again from our level. If they are using this kind of product, from where.\\nCustomer: Did you check the screenshot that you have taken? 9th of October there was a search.\\nExecutive: Sir, all these things are in the mail.\\nCustomer: Hello, hello, hello, can you listen for a minute what I am saying? If you are answering yourself, I will keep the phone here. Talk and then you cut it.\\nExecutive: Tell me sir.\\nCustomer: You are not listening to what I am saying, you are answering something. Then why are you calling me? I will keep the phone next to me, after you finish talking, cut it.\\nExecutive: Tell me sir.\\nCustomer: 9th of October there was a visit, room integrity test for gas suppression service in Mumbai.\\nExecutive: Where are you going?\\nCustomer: In Mumbai.\\nCustomer: Why should I search like that? If there is a requirement.\\nExecutive: Yeah, right sir. So, no sir, I will highlight what it is.\\nCustomer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hello?\\nCustomer: Yes.\\nExecutive: Sorry sir. So, in this, we have additionally logged out. Your restriction, that is, without this ID, we have updated it to the extent that we cannot log in in anything else. We have disabled the password login option. So, we have updated this also.\\nCustomer: That is already disabled.\\nCustomer: That is already disabled. Your previous IndiaMART relationship manager only enabled it and bought the password from me and they were updating it.\\nCustomer: Remember?\\nExecutive: Sir, they are not working right now, actually.\\nCustomer: I don't know that. As far as I am concerned, IndiaMART, whether they are working or not.\\nCustomer: Your IndiaMART previous colleague only bought the password from me and they were logging in and using it. By lead sale, exploring everything.\\nCustomer: Based on recommendation from your manager.\\nCustomer: Okay, they did not come and ask. Your manager recommended it and after that they bought all the passwords and then shared it. We had a team Google Meet also with your manager and Ilakkiya.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: Okay sir. So, as far as I am concerned, IndiaMART only. Whether they are here or not, we don't know. It is from IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Okay. So, the password was disabled till then. Only after that, the password was enabled and the password was given.\\nExecutive: Okay.\\nCustomer: Everything I have done based on IndiaMART requirement or IndiaMART request. We hadn't done anything apart from your request.\\nExecutive: Sir, now, if I search for a topic, if I don't take a requirement, if you are posting an ad, it says, it's nothing like that, I could have asked you.\\nExecutive: Sir, because of the reason that there is a single IP address, I am telling you this word, sir. I will change it for you.\\nCustomer: I am only saying, don't send screenshots. Prove me that I have taken.\\nCustomer: I am not there, that is why I am talking to you so seriously. I don't want any screenshots. Prove me that this is the only one activity which is happening. Now you are taking IP address, take IP address for all these posts for this time. Take it and then share it.\\nExecutive: Okay sir.\\nCustomer: Thank you.\\nCustomer: Bye.",
