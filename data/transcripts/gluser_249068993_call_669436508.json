  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\n\\nExecutive: Hello? Good afternoon sir, I am speaking from Srishti.\\n\\nCustomer: Ji, boliye. (Yes, tell me.)\\n\\nExecutive: Kamlesh ji, Maruti Mangal Stone Clouds right?\\n\\nCustomer: Ji, ji, ji, ji, ji. (Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.)\\n\\nExecutive: Sir, I am speaking from IndiaMART. Your request is open, meaning that you have marked some buyleads as not relevant again?\\n\\nCustomer: Aaj? (Today?)\\n\\nExecutive: Aaj nahi, pura in matlab jitne bhi ye month gaye November month mein, in mein. (Not today, in the entire, meaning all the months that have passed in the month of November, in these.)\\n\\nCustomer: Not relevant kaha mara hai? (Where have I marked not relevant?)\\n\\nExecutive: Nahi mara? (Didn't mark?)\\n\\nCustomer: Aapke paas call aaya bhi hoga, ek minute rukiye. (You must have received a call, wait a minute.)\\n\\nExecutive: 9 tarikh ko, kal ki date mein aapke paas call bhi aaya hoga kisi ka. (On the 9th, yesterday's date, you must have received a call from someone.)\\n\\nCustomer: Call nahi kaha aaya? (Where did the call come from?)\\n\\nExecutive: Nahi nahi call kuch nahi aaya. (No, no, no call came.)\\n\\nExecutive: Aapne call kiya hai kisi ka? (Have you called someone?)\\n\\nCustomer: Maine call kiya tha. (I had called.)\\n\\nExecutive: Achha, aapne call kiya tha? (Oh, you had called?)\\n\\nCustomer: Haan, to buylead nahi aata. (Yes, so buyleads don't come.)\\n\\nExecutive: Aap to call mujhe karte hai na, to mere paas call aaya. (You call me, right? So the call came to me.)\\n\\nCustomer: Kal Sunday tha na. (Yesterday was Sunday, right?)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan. (Yes.)\\n\\nCustomer: Kal Sunday tha na, aapka chutti hai na? (Yesterday was Sunday, right? You have a holiday, right?)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan, chutti rehta hai. (Yes, it's a holiday.)\\n\\nExecutive: To isiliye agar aap, vaise to mere ko Sunday bhi rehta hai, to bhi aap mujhe call kar sakte hai, aisa koi problem nahi hai, thik hai? (So that's why, if you, although I have Sunday too, you can still call me, there is no problem like that, okay?)\\nExecutive: Main call receive kar leti hu. (I receive the call.)\\n\\nExecutive: But agar aap aise call karte hai, to vo kya hota hai ki aapki request open kar dete hai. (But if you make calls like this, then what happens is that they open your request.)\\n\\nExecutive: Abhi aap bol rahe, matlab ki aapko not relevant matlab product ke related bhi buyleads nahi aa rahi hai na? (Now you are saying, meaning that you are not getting buyleads related to the product, right?)\\n\\nCustomer: Nahi aa rahi. (Not coming.)\\n\\nExecutive: Ek minute rukiyega. (Wait a minute.)\\n\\nCustomer: Vahi baat main kal bata raha tha. (I was telling the same thing yesterday.)\\n\\nExecutive: Achha. (Okay.)\\n\\nCustomer: Bata raha tha ki vo bol raha tha ki. (I was telling that he was saying that.)\\n\\nExecutive: Fir kya bataya fir unhone? (Then what did they tell you?)\\n\\nCustomer: 350 se not relevant kiye, main bola jo hamara related hai hi nahi to usko main kyu rakhu? (350 have been marked as not relevant, I said why should I keep the ones that are not related to us?)\\nCustomer: Kya 350 ka beech mein main dhundte rahu kab aaya, kidhar hai, kaha gaya? (Why should I keep searching in the middle of 350 when it came, where it is, where it went?)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan, thik hai. (Yes, okay.)\\n\\nCustomer: To usko not relevant hi maroge na, to usko rakh ke kya karu? (So you will mark it as not relevant, right? So what should I do by keeping it?)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan, fir uske baad kya bola unhone? (Yes, then what did they say?)\\n\\nCustomer: Vo usne mere ko samjhane laga tum isliye karte ho isiliye tumhare paas nahi aata. (He started explaining to me that you do this, that's why it doesn't come to you.)\\nCustomer: Main bola aata nahi ko hum isliye iske liye register kiye the kya? (I said, it doesn't come, so did we register for this?)\\nCustomer: Hum jo cheez register kiye vo nahi aata isko kyu rakh ke kya kare? (The thing that we registered for doesn't come, so what should we do by keeping it?)\\nCustomer: Ki bolte isiliye tum not relevant mar dete ho isiliye nahi aata. (He says that's why you mark not relevant, that's why it doesn't come.)\\nCustomer: Main bola idhar udhar ka baat ghuma fira ke mat kijiye. (I said don't twist the words here and there.)\\nCustomer: Aap naya ho aapko kuch kaam pata nahi hai. (You are new, you don't know anything about the work.)\\n\\nExecutive: Bilkul baat sahi hai. (Absolutely right.)\\n\\nCustomer: Thik hai bole nahi hum dekh lenge, hum complaint request dal denge. (Okay, he said no, we will see, we will put a complaint request.)\\nCustomer: Main bola ye sab aise idhar udhar ka baat mat kare, jo kaam hai vahi kariye. (I said don't talk like this here and there, do what you have to do.)\\nCustomer: Aur kuch mere ko dusra kuch bol rahe the ki aapka kuch kya bol rahe the? (And they were saying something else to me that you have some, what were they saying?)\\n\\nExecutive: Keyword? (Keyword?)\\n\\nExecutive: Yaha par mention kiya hai unhone. (They have mentioned it here.)\\n\\nCustomer: Kya keyword ka kuch. (What about the keyword?)\\n\\nExecutive: Kya keyword bhi add karana chahte the. (They wanted to add keywords.)\\n\\nCustomer: Haan, keyword ka baat karte. (Yes, they were talking about keywords.)\\nCustomer: Main bola keyword ka add karna to baat sahi hai lekin jab teen mahina hua abhi tak add kyu nahi hua to aaj ye baat aap kyu bol rahe ho? (I said it's right to add keywords, but why are you saying this today when it's been three months and it hasn't been added yet?)\\n\\nCustomer: Jo karna hai to kar lo, mere ko kuch nahi karna hai, mere ko sirf chalana hai, mera paas buylead jo 17 hai usko consume karne ke liye mere ko platform chahiye matlab ki iske kaise kaise use karu, bas mere ko utna chahiye, kya karna hai kya nahi hum log ko utna zimmedari nahi lena hai. (Do whatever you want to do, I don't want to do anything, I just want to run it, I need a platform to consume the 17 buyleads I have, meaning how to use it, I just need that much, what to do and what not to do, we don't want to take that much responsibility.)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan. (Yes.)\\n\\nCustomer: To hum log ko hum jo 17 milta hai vo 17 ko kaha pe use karu, kuch hoga to use karenge na to kaise use karenge? (So where should we use the 17 that we get, if there is something then we will use it, so how will we use it?)\\n\\nExecutive: Bilkul baat sahi hai. (Absolutely right.)\\n\\nExecutive: Nahi nahi vo maine na aapka account aage forward to kiya tha. (No, no, I had forwarded your account.)\\nExecutive: Jo aapke sandstone statue ka hai na buylead, aap jisme sabse jyada deal karte hai, usme hamari team ki side se 18 keyword add kar diye gaye hai aapke product pe. (The buylead of your sandstone statue, in which you deal the most, 18 keywords have been added to your product from our team's side.)\\n\\nCustomer: Koi bhi agar kuch bhi dalega sandstone ke related to bhi aapke paas buylead aayegi. (Even if someone puts anything related to sandstone, you will get buyleads.)\\n\\nExecutive: Jaise 1.5. (Like 1.5.)\\n\\nCustomer: Haan, bataiye please. (Yes, please tell.)\\n\\nCustomer: Do do hafta ho gaya kuch nahi aata hai, ek gaya hafte mein main kya kiya na shanivar last raat ko matlab raat ko 7:30 8:00 baje kuch jo char panch bacha tha usko ek hi baar hi consume kar liya lekin aise mufat mein jayega kya? (It's been two weeks, nothing comes, what did I do last week on Saturday night, meaning at 7:30 8:00 at night, I consumed the four or five that were left at once, but will it go to waste like this?)\\nCustomer: To usko consume kar lete, consume karke kuch to fayda hi nahi kyuki aata hi nahi to use kidhar kare? (So let's consume it, there is no benefit to consuming it because it doesn't come, so where to use it?)\\nCustomer: Abhi dekho 10 ka 10 pada hai, aaj kya kaun sa shanivar ko aaj somvar ho gaya, teen din ye ho gaya. (Now see 10 out of 10 are lying, today is Monday from Saturday, three days have passed.)\\n\\nExecutive: Somvar. (Monday.)\\n\\nCustomer: Shanivar gaya, ravivar, somvar, do din ho gaya, do din ka bhi shayad aaj ka bhi use nahi hua abhi tak. (Saturday passed, Sunday, Monday, two days have passed, maybe today's has not been used yet.)\\n\\nExecutive: Vo baat sahi hai but ye char ghante pehle aapke paas aayi thi Nandi statue ki buylead, but unko ek hi product chahiye tha, to karenge ek product mein, ek product mein to nahi fayda milega na aapko. (That's right, but four hours ago you had a buylead for Nandi statue, but they wanted only one product, so they will do it in one product, you will not get benefit in one product, right?)\\n\\nCustomer: Hoga kyu nahi, jo convert hoga to hoga kyu nahi? (Why won't it happen, if it converts then why won't it happen?)\\n\\nExecutive: Achha, to hai Shiv Shiv Parivar statue humne jo product dala tha uska bhi hai, Nandi statue uska bhi hai. (Okay, so there is also Shiv Shiv Parivar statue that we put the product, there is also Nandi statue.)\\nExecutive: Stone Nandi idol Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh se aaya hai. (Stone Nandi idol has come from Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh.)\\n\\nCustomer: Ji, matlab usme kya hai na jo prefer location dikhata hai na usme se do char char char che hi show karta hai. (Yes, meaning what is there in it is that the preferred location that it shows, it only shows two four four four six.)\\nCustomer: Matlab hum jaise paani liya to paani liya hona chahiye na, to char che usme jo green tick mark ka hua na. (Meaning if we take water then it should be taken water, right, so four six in it which has a green tick mark.)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan. (Yes.)\\n\\nCustomer: Usme jaise three dot jaake aapne bol rahe the ki buyleads mein jaake niche jo show karta hai jis din aapne not relevant jaisa nahi tha jo mark ho gaya tha nahi aa raha tha. (In that, like going to three dots, you were saying that going to buyleads, the one that shows below, the day you didn't have not relevant like the one that was marked, it was not coming.)\\n\\nExecutive: Usme location ka prefer vo shayad saat aath kuch hai, matlab saat aath hi hai to jyada hi hai na. (In that, the preferred location is maybe seven eight something, meaning seven eight is more, right?)\\n\\nCustomer: To vahi saat aath location kyu show karta hai matlab aage jaake jyada show karega tabhi to fir dikhayega na. (So why does it show only seven eight locations, meaning if it shows more ahead then it will show, right?)\\n\\nExecutive: Bilkul baat sahi hai, aap bhi Jaipur mein deal karte hai aap? (Absolutely right, do you also deal in Jaipur?)\\n\\nCustomer: Jaipur, Jaipur to hab hai udhar deal karke kuch fayda hi nahi, sirf use karke mufat mein. (Jaipur, Jaipur is a hub, there is no benefit in dealing there, just use it for free.)\\nCustomer: Matlab sirf baat karna uske udhar jab hab hai to idhar ka baat nahi karna se achha hai. (Meaning just talking, when there is a hub there, it is better not to talk about here.)\\n\\nExecutive: Thik hai, to abhi hum kya kar rahe hai na aapki request open hui hai to usme kya karenge hum aapke aur bhi keyword add kar rahe hai. (Okay, so what we are doing now is that your request is open, so what we will do in that is that we are adding more keywords to you.)\\nExecutive: Aap inko jante honge Manmohan Stones ko. (You must know them Manmohan Stones.)\\n\\nExecutive: Inka account hai na, inhone jaise jaise ye bhi na aapke hi product mein deal karte hai sandstone aur in sab mein. (They have an account, they also deal in your product sandstone and all these.)\\n\\nExecutive: To inhone jo jo product mein keyword add kiya hai na hum vahi product keyword aapke mein bhi add karenge. (So whatever product keyword they have added, we will add the same product keyword in yours.)\\n\\nCustomer: Ji. (Yes.)\\n\\nExecutive: Thik hai? (Okay?)\\n\\nExecutive: To ek baar aap usko dekhiyega, fir ek baar mujhe batayega, ek minute rukiyega, ek minute rukiyega. (So once you see that, then tell me once, wait a minute, wait a minute.)\\n\\nCustomer: Inhone na, main aapko dikha deti hu. (They have, let me show you.)\\n\\nExecutive: Inhone ne jaise sandstone hai, sandstone ke humne to 18 hi kiye hai, but inhone 52 apne keyword add kiye hai, 52. (They have like sandstone, we have only done 18 of sandstone, but they have added 52 of their keywords, 52.)\\n\\nExecutive: Ek hi product ke aur stone temple ke 57. (For one product and 57 for stone temple.)\\nExecutive: Ek baar aap join ho sakte hai video meet se, aap ek baar dekhiye inka fir mujhe batayega ki kaun sa sahi hai, to vo bhi main bhi aapke mein hi add karva deti hu. (You can join once from video meet, you see them once then tell me which one is right, so I will get that added in yours too.)\\n\\nExecutive: Main screen share kar rahi hu, ek minute rukiyega. (I am sharing the screen, wait a minute.)\\n\\nCustomer: To whatsapp mein bhejna padega aapko link. (So you have to send the link in whatsapp.)\\n\\nExecutive: Whatsapp pe bhejungi, haan whatsapp pe bhejungi, koi problem nahi hai, mujhe dekh ke bhi batayiyega. (I will send it on whatsapp, yes I will send it on whatsapp, there is no problem, tell me after seeing it.)\\n\\nCustomer: Kal bhi bol rahe whatsapp pe bheje bole link kya main bola hazar baar link mein aa chuka hu google meet mein. (Yesterday also they were saying send it on whatsapp, what link, I said I have come in the link a thousand times in Google Meet.)\\nExecutive: To bolte hai hamara nahi hamara nahi share kar sakte. (So they say we can't share our.)\\nExecutive: Main bola nahi karna hai to nahi karo, jo bolna hai to seedha seedha bol do, idhar udhar. (I said if you don't want to do it then don't do it, whatever you want to say, say it straight, here and there.)\\n\\nExecutive: Achha vo whatsapp pe nahi bhej rahe the kya? (Oh, they were not sending it on whatsapp?)\\n\\nCustomer: Nahi vo bheje nahi, link nahi bheje mere ko kal. (No, they didn't send, they didn't send me the link yesterday.)\\nCustomer: Bol rahe the ki main fir mail id mein bheje, main bola mera mail id bheje. (They were saying that I will send it in the mail id, I said send my mail id.)\\nCustomer: Fir bhej nahi paye, fir vo sara baat ki main bola rakho phone mere ko bhi jyada bakwas karke aisa time rakhne ka mere ko. (Then they couldn't send it, then they talked all that, I said keep the phone, I also have to keep time by talking nonsense.)\\n\\nExecutive: Achha, shayad ji pata nahi unke paas shayad authorize nahi hoga. (Okay, maybe they don't know, maybe they don't have authorization.)\\nExecutive: Ek minute rukiye, ye ek baar number bataiye last mein ye 554. (Wait a minute, tell me the number once at the end, this 554.)\\n\\nCustomer: Nahi nahi 13 70713. (No no 13 70713.)\\n\\nExecutive: Ek minute rukiyega bas. (Wait a minute.)\\n\\nExecutive: 0713? (0713?)\\n\\nCustomer: Ji, ji. (Yes, yes.)\\n\\nExecutive: Thik hai. (Okay.)\\n\\nExecutive: Ek minute rukiyega. (Wait a minute.)\\n\\nExecutive: Check kariye, aaya? (Check, did it come?)\\n\\nCustomer: Aa gaya. (It came.)\\n\\nExecutive: Haan, join hoiye. (Yes, join.)\\n\\nCustomer: Call katna padega.
