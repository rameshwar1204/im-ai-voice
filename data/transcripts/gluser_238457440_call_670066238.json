  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hello.\\nCustomer: Haan. Yeah, hi Ladida. Uh, this, uh, hi, okay, okay, yes.\\nExecutive: This, this side calling you from IndiaMART, actually. Haan, okay, got it. I was busy, you know, that's why.\\nExecutive: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I, I tried connecting with you, but your number was not reachable.\\nCustomer: No, okay, okay.\\nExecutive: Yeah. So, uh, as we discussed last time that you were facing this language issue.\\nCustomer: Yeah. Okay.\\nExecutive: So, this anyways we can figure it out because we are creating a online presence, uh, through IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Okay. Right. So, it is not only about converting those leads and getting business from IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: It is also about, uh, creating an online presence.\\nCustomer: Hmm.\\nExecutive: So, I would suggest you Ladida that, uh, we should not be impatient on this part.\\nCustomer: Hmm.\\nExecutive: And, uh, obviously, I mean, in the worst case scenario also, even if things doesn't turn out,\\nExecutive: We will anyways, uh, uh, will create a online impact or presence, right?\\nCustomer: Hmm.\\nExecutive: That's the reason I'm insisting you that, uh, let's start from here positively.\\nCustomer: Hmm hmm.\\nExecutive: And I'm sure, uh, the minimum results which we are expecting, uh, because this is not like you are investing on some random company.\\nCustomer: Hmm. Right.\\nExecutive: Uh, even if we coordinate and, uh, if we do things in the right manner and if we, uh, put down the right inputs, I'm sure the graph will be in a positive manner only.\\nCustomer: Yeah. We, I know that, but the problem is we cannot convert the leads. Like, you know, we have to, um, motivate them or like, we have to give them our idea, you know, we cannot do that because they\\nExecutive: [inaudible]\\nCustomer: You know, the language barrier is so high that we cannot, uh, convert the leads into our like buyers, you know, that's the problem actually.\\nExecutive: So, you are, uh, we can't do that. Yeah.\\nExecutive: So, are you dealing, uh, within your location or, uh, is it, uh, all over India?\\nCustomer: No. I think she dealt with, uh, yeah, all over India. She dealt with some, uh, Haryana or Punjabi guy and she cannot process it, you know. It's not her fault, like, not yours also. So, only, like, you know, she doesn't know English or, uh, Hindi or something, like, any other language. She only knows Malayalam. That's the problem, you know.\\nExecutive: Okay.\\nCustomer: Yeah. And when she, uh, okay, okay.\\nExecutive: Let's say if you are dealing, so in this way you will be restricted within your location, right?\\nCustomer: Yeah, yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, yeah.\\nExecutive: Right. Hmm. But, uh, if we somehow sort this out, then the radius will be huge where you can make business or do business, right?\\nCustomer: Yeah, but, you know, somehow our business have to go within by ourselves, you know, not like, like you cannot, we cannot rely on you all the time, right? That's the problem. So, she's facing that it's a huge problem with her, like, the language, [inaudible].\\nExecutive: Ladida, you don't have to think in this manner that we are here for the next three months, four months. Uh, think on a longer run.\\nCustomer: Yeah, we are thinking like that only. But the problem is, like, we cannot rely on anyone else. Like, we have to build our business, right? She cannot do that.\\nExecutive: One or the other day we will definitely will figure out something, but if you are ending your online presence, then nothing can help you. You need to understand in this way.\\nCustomer: Yeah, I know. But, uh, you know, hmm.\\nExecutive: That is the reason I'm saying that we can definitely, uh, find out a midway. Hmm.\\nExecutive: Right. Hmm hmm. Definitely we can find out a midway and we can solve it. But for that, uh, we have to think in a progressive manner.\\nCustomer: Yeah, we are thinking in a progressive manner, but the language barrier is so high here. That's the problem. Like, I cannot, she cannot rely on me all the time.\\nExecutive: See, see, see, Ladida, uh, Malayalam is the most difficult language in, in the world.\\nCustomer: Right, sir, mother tongue, so, you know, it's our mother tongue, so that we are fluent in that. It's not that big deal, you know.\\nExecutive: Because I studied in Bengaluru, even I tried, uh, to learn Kannada and somehow, uh, at least I was able to understand what the person is trying to say, but if I talk about Malayalam language, it's very difficult.\\nCustomer: Yeah. Yeah. That's why, like, it's not your mother tongue, that's why. If, if our mother tongue is any difficult language, we will learn that. That's our, you know, day-to-day communication, it's necessary for our day-to-day communication, no? That's why, like, yeah, but we cannot, uh, we tried learning English and English and Hindi, like, for her. But it's not working out. She is, like, 45 year old, so she cannot, you know, learn that much easily. That's the problem.\\nExecutive: Yeah, even if you get lead from Kerala, uh, or somehow we are together, if you are able to convert one or two leads, it will get you the, the minimum ROI from for, for the business.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: You will be on the, you know, profit and only even if we convert one or two leads. So, I mean, getting a lead from, from other than Kerala location, that is a different thing. But even if, uh, okay. Basically our priority will be, see, if somebody already we have least suppliers available on IndiaMART, uh, from Kerala location.\\nCustomer: Yeah, I know it. That's the problem.\\nExecutive: So, and, and, and if you think in this way that, uh, somehow if you are, if you are being present on our platform, definitely we have no other option than giving you the priority. Hmm. Right? Hmm.\\nExecutive: So, that is the reason I'm insisting that let's give it a try from both of our ends. Okay? We can connect again after 15, 20 days so that we can calculate or we can evaluate what exactly happened and\\nCustomer: So, let me discuss with that with her, okay? What you have said, let me discuss with her, then I will talk to you, okay?\\nExecutive: Yeah, yeah, sure. So, then, then let's connect tomorrow, uh, in the first half. Okay? Okay.\\n",
