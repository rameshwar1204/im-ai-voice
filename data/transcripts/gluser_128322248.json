  "transcript": "Customer: Hello.\\nExecutive: Hello.\\nCustomer: [Unintelligible]\\nExecutive: Good evening. Diya mam, I am Priya from IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Tell me.\\nExecutive: I am sorry to disturb. I am Madhavan's manager speaking, mam.\\nCustomer: Tell me.\\nExecutive: So recently, for the call that he spoke to us today, we have received a tagging that I am not satisfied. If they have not given us any clear suggestion at their level, what is the reason that we are not satisfied, mam? Madhavan, what problem did you tell him?\\nCustomer: By-lead, whenever I open it, non-relevant to you, non-relevant to you is what it says. I am not consuming by-lead at all. Last month, with September, last month, look at my by-lead, it is going waste.\\nExecutive: Okay. I will clear the first thing. Is my voice clear? Your voice is breaking and coming to me.\\nCustomer: Hello. It is breaking.\\nExecutive: Tell me. It is clear to me. Is it clear?\\nExecutive: Actually, mam, first thing, I will clear it. So Madhavan, the feedback that they spoke is what we had asked you to give ratings here. So you have given not satisfied. Other than that, when IndiaMART is not clear to you, what should you do is, in the lead manager, in what all lead taking, you are getting the result or not, did Madhavan guide you with a past lead option?\\nCustomer: No, he did not guide me anything by opening the app.\\nExecutive: He did not guide you anything by opening the app?\\nCustomer: Aha, no.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay. Now, normally, in the IndiaMART app, if you open the page for by-lead,\\nCustomer: Hello, tell me. Tell me.\\nExecutive: If you open the page for by-lead, on the right side, we will have an arrow mark like. Under the three dots, there will be an arrow mark like. Okay? So when we click that, you will see an option called past leads. That past leads\\nCustomer: Before that, Swathi guided me. They had told me and taught me. We are doing that only.\\nExecutive: Okay. Similarly, in the lead manager, in case if these enquiries are relevant to you or not, in that option, are you giving a thumbs up symbol? Yeah, this is okay, I need this kind of lead, like okay or this kind of lead is not relevant to us, are you giving feedback like that?\\nCustomer: I am giving one or two like that.\\nExecutive: Okay, all the clients are mainly going with replies, mam. It is going on. I am not giving without reply to anyone.\\nExecutive: Okay, look at doing replies a little regularly. What all factors will increase the lead for you, I will tell you, mam. First thing, if we see, if you are continuously consuming the lead for each product, that is one. Okay? Consuming the lead and replying is two. Similarly, giving feedback for that lead, that thumbs up, thumbs down option. Even in that past leads, going and giving interested option.\\nExecutive: So these four options are, when the lead comes for you, to give you first priority maximum, it will be a main thing. And not only that, for a month, you have given 13 products. Cotton paint, bandage, absorbent cause, that cause roll bandage, medical cause and surgical bandage, these are all what we are doing, right?\\nCustomer: Yes.\\nExecutive: For this product, monthly, if we see, from 400 to 500, we are having lead generated happening. So this thing will not come only to you, like you, some other suppliers will be there, right? To them also, together only it will come. You, a by-lead, we can consume from four to five people. Okay? After those four to five people are done, that such a lead has come, you will not have a knowledge for that. That is, you will not get notified.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: Are you understanding? Another one is, now totally, there are 11 products, let's say. In that 11 products, you have six products in high sold category. High sold category in the means, very demand one. Like I said, lead generated within some minutes, that lead, to consume, the suppliers, that is, like you suppliers, within 15 minutes, immediately consuming level, they will be active. Plus, they will be in big service also. That is what it means. So this factor, because of this reason, you have this kind of thing. That you, to cross and come, if we see, I said those four options.\\nExecutive: So if you follow that, we will clear this, mam. You follow this for one week. So according to that, we will have results perfectly, mam.\\nCustomer: Okay, okay.\\nExecutive: Okay? So we, in our level, what else to do to get results, we will update here and we will follow you. Save my number also, we, what all, whatever it is, you can reach me directly. Okay?\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: Okay, mam. Any doubt, mam?\\nCustomer: No doubt. Swathi was there, till September, they supported me fully. I did not use all by-leads. One or two orders also they placed. Last month, whenever I open the app, no relevant by-lead, no relevant by-lead is there, always it is showing. Okay. Above that, if I consume by-lead and speak also, just for sample, one piece, two piece or for V2 use, if I just see, it is showing you, they are saying, I did not see at all, they are saying. I am daily one lead at least using and seeing. Relevant one.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay.\\nExecutive: Okay, mam. You follow this, mam. In our level, what support is there, we will do and reach you again.\\nCustomer: Okay, okay. Thank you.\\nExecutive: Yeah. Thank you, mam. Any doubt is there, mam?\\nCustomer: No doubt.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay. So for this call, feedback also we will receive, mam. You give positively. Support will be definitely there from our end, mam.
