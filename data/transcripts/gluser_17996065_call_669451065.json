  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hello?\\nCustomer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hi Shruti here.\\nCustomer: Hello yeah hi Shruti hi.\\nExecutive: Hi hi ma'am.\\nCustomer: So we have you know received the complaint from your end regarding the export buyleads where like you have mentioned like from few countries were not like fetching good amount of buyleads which are like.\\nCustomer: I'll tell you I'll tell you the whole issue. My current request as of now was for account cancellation and I'll tell you the reasons behind it.\\nCustomer: I guess you got in touch with me six months ago it was you only?\\nExecutive: Yeah right at the time of renewal right yeah.\\nCustomer: So actually at the time of renewal I was I was not at all ready for the renewal because of the same exact same things which are happening right now. Either the leads are irrelevant or they are from the countries I have specifically marked I am not dealing in first of all.\\nCustomer: Second of all I I specifically had this problem for from a very long time and the last year I told this Mr. Ayush it has been a complete waste worry. First of all the money that I am paying to IndiaMART that is a complete waste. It is not any less amount it is not 10000 15000 right? That was a complete waste. Second I have a person me as well my time and money as well and specifically one person as well one two people I have assigned for IndiaMART exports. I am giving them free salary every month. You might understand for a post of you know export sales person how much would the salary be minimum 20 30k right? So that also I am paying them for free every month they are doing not doing anything because there is no business from IndiaMART. They are just searching up clients talking to them. IndiaMART as per they are receiving nothing at all.\\nCustomer: So my only thing is that I have been you know saying telling about this problem for from a very long time. First of all my major issues which were at the time of renewal that there are no leads it is still there. Now at least there there are leads and they are irrelevant absolutely irrelevant. For example I am dealing in dog products I am dealing in only and only two dog products. One is dog bite suit another is dog bite sleeve that's all. And other than those two products that I am dealing in I receive queries and leads for all other dog equipments. Dog harness dog clothes dog collar everything I receive everything absolutely irrelevant for me which I have told to Mr. Ayush 100 times. I can send you I even asked him to add you in the group he didn't I don't know why. I can send you screenshots of the group that all I am doing all day is just sending him screenshots of the irrelevant leads I am getting reporting to him every day and any time I tell him an issue he just says ma'am please take a time for meeting please tell but I I just want to know what kind of platform is this that I am investing my money also my time also my energy also and then for an issue resolution also I have to invest my time and time and energy again. I am dealing with multiple platforms I am not this fed up with any platform. Literally it is taking my money which has gone to a complete waste. Last year was a complete waste. This year is a complete waste. I literally as per Mr. Ayush promises he said ma'am I will send the leads to you personally in the group we will make a group he made a group he did nothing. He didn't send me a single lead.\\nCustomer: And only in that group I am the only one who is sending every day screenshots that this lead is irrelevant irrelevant. You can check my dashboards amount of leads I am consuming. Another issue there are leads you know named like how irrelevant is it I don't know how India algorithm works. It is literally put as you know Ludhiana Punjab United Kingdom. When once I purchased the lead of UK it was named only UK there is only the country present. The full address was Ludhiana Punjab United Kingdom and the and the number and everything and even if the number is from outside people are from India they are saying they need a delivery here only.\\nCustomer: So I don't know how it is working and it has been a complete mess and a complete waste of time. So my only I don't think that you are you know your team is capable of resolving this. So I really would only request for a refund that is all I can do because I cannot invest any more time and energy in this. And if you are offering me a solution then you know I my only question would be why that solution was not done earlier and if you are offering me a solution I am ready to work of course I want to work. Nobody is there who doesn't want to do business if you are saying okay ma'am we will provide you leads and then only I want a extend of six months which have been a complete waste. You can literally I am not lying you can check my dashboard it has been a complete waste. I have not consumed leads the leads are absolutely irrelevant. I can send you detail of each and every lead that how irrelevant they were either they were from India either they wanted delivery in India or anything they were not at all or or they were not responding or the first very first problem is there are no leads they are irrelevant leads.\\nCustomer: The all the products that I'm not leading in.\\nCustomer: I can send you like 100 150 screenshots right now and each screenshot has two or three leads. I can send you would send you absolute irrelevant database of 500 leads right now which I have shared in the group in the last two three months.\\nCustomer: That I have like already today actually I was aware about this thing Ayush has like you know connected on this customer care team then I have like Can you please can you please connect to me with a private number because actually I am not being able to understand there is a network issue.\\nExecutive: Uh private\\nExecutive: won't be able to make private call because the\\n",
