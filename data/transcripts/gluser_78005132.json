  "transcript": "Customer: Hello.\\nExecutive: Hello, very good afternoon, Rajesh sir from IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Ji, ji, ji, ji, haan, very good afternoon madam. Ji boliye.\\nExecutive: Haan bataiye, aap India pe hai na?\\nCustomer: Nahi madam, main China hoon filhaal.\\nExecutive: Achcha China, aisa ek feedback.\\nCustomer: Haan ji boliye.\\nExecutive: Haan ek feedback aapka receive hua tha, isme koi service lekar koi content dikkat pareshani hai to bata dijiyega. Taki main jyada der aapse baat bhi nahi karungi, sirf aapse connect kar leti hoon. Ek feedback received, ek ticket open ho gaya, isi ke bihaf pe.\\nCustomer: Iske bihaf pe? Maine to koi feedback nahi diya aapko.\\nExecutive: Haan fake buylead ka, just checking nothing.\\nCustomer: Achcha wo haan, actually, actually aapke senior se bhi mera baat hua tha abhi pichle dino. Kal parso mera jo hai na, aapke senior se mera baat hua tha, to maine unse baat kiya tha. Actually mein kya hai ki aap logo ke yahan pe jo buylead aati hai na, wo jaise main kisi ne bhi check kiya ho IndiaMART pe, machine ko check kiya, he is not eager to buy.\\nCustomer: Samajh rahe hain? Wo eager nahi hai wo machine ko, wo just apna time pass kar raha hai, dekh raha hai. Thik hai na? Aapne utha ke usko buylead bana diya. So I am getting this type of buyleads continuously last from few months.\\nExecutive: Achcha, yehi hai.\\nCustomer: Haan, haan wo mera unse discuss hua is bare mein. Maine unko bataya bhi ki madam ye jo hai na ye aisa kyunki actually kya hai ki when we are calling to somebody else, they are feeling very much bad. Understand?\\nExecutive: Haan.\\nCustomer: Haan, they are not replying a proper way also. Just I call him, hello sir, how are you? You have need of this one machine. So they talk little bad way, understand? Because they don't have need of that one machine and we are calling unnecessarily. So I let that this call to your senior also.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay.\\nCustomer: To main, you should not take this type of, somebody is just come on the website, just checking the machine for a little time, just he is, he want to know about this one machine, nothing, he is not eager to buy that one. But he is just checking the machine and you make it as a buylead and send to me. So I, I will take it that one buylead from your side and I give him a call. That's why he is feeling very much bad for that. So this is not happening the single time, it is happening continuously. So this is my concern. So you should be take care about this one. Now I think maybe, now you get it my point also.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay, when you coming back in India?\\nCustomer: Haan, I will come back on 12th of December madam.\\nExecutive: 12th of December, okay then that time we will connect you with your meeting and sort out some further masking corrections and each and everything. With your permission shall I close this concern?\\nCustomer: Oh, actually remaining is all, all okay, there is no more issue. Only this is issue because everyday, everyday I, I am finding one buylead this type of and they are not replying a proper way also. Proper means they are talking little bad also. Just from disconnecting me.\\nExecutive: Actually providing a buylead is a network of opportunity. It's not a 100% guaranteed lead.\\nCustomer: No, that is you know, no, just somebody come on the website, he is searching, just lot of time we are also looking the machine. But you, you should not make that one as a buylead because at least this type of person who is coming and not asking the machine and all. So at least give a call and ask him, do you have need this type of machine? We want to make a buylead, we will supply, we will avail the suppliers for that. But you are directly making a buylead for that and serve to us also. So when we are getting that one.\\nExecutive: That type of buylead we need to really recognize and reduce this type of who is searching, who is searching IndiaMART platform and providing lead and we have to.\\nCustomer: Haan, this type of but definitely we are, we are working on and we will sort out the content.\\nExecutive: You should, you should, you should do. Madam you should do work on it because I am the very frank person. I let you clearly what is going with me. So I am not feeling good for that because everyday I finding one person and he is not talking me a proper way and all. He is talking in a bad way. So whole day it is disturb my whole day, understand?\\nExecutive: Correct hai, correct hai. And actually we are already discussed your point in the last to last month that to categorize spiral screw shredder and the cloth waste.\\nCustomer: Yeah, yeah, that is okay, that is okay, still it is going on, just we are waiting for that. When I will come back then I will call you back madam for and we will discuss about that.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay, I am waiting for your okay that time and after 12th of December we will connect and we will sort out the further concern.
