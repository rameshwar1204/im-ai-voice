Namaste, I am speaking from IndiaMART.\\nCustomer: Haan.\\nExecutive: So, Mansukh Lal Sales, you have a profile with us, right?\\nCustomer: Haan ji, haan ji.\\nExecutive: Yes, so I am seeing some issue there, because of which some of your products are not visible on the catalog.\\nCustomer: Okay. What is this inactive?\\nExecutive: Inactive means, the products that you have inactivated for a particular time, that you are not dealing in, or there are two reasons for this, either you deactivate it yourself, or second, the system rejects it.\\nCustomer: I know about reject, but I don't know about inactive, that it is active.\\nExecutive: Inactive. Ma'am, active and inactive, this is the opponent of the active. Active means the active products, inactive means just like a deactive product.\\nExecutive: Like, inactive product is happening due to two reasons, it is getting rejected just because of the system, okay, that either there will be a product issue, or there will be an image issue, because of this the system automatically rejects it.\\nCustomer: But there is no product issue, but why is it showing like that? I have not done it myself, there is no issue in it, there is only one mixer, I need to do that.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay. Rejected product, in this way product issue, what are the parameters in it, it will be a different dimension, right? So it automatically gets rejected, it could be happening because of the image size, or whatever specification product you have put, or pricing you have put, or the name you have put, it is not matching with our system or AI platform, so this is automatically system rejects it.\\nExecutive: So, because of this it can happen, or you can once see all your rejected photos.\\nCustomer: Actually, I want to make that mixer live, but there is no issue, I have uploaded everything through AI, its specifications are clear.\\nCustomer: I have taken its help, but I don't think there should be any problem.\\nExecutive: No, no, right now whatever products you have put, all of them are running at 90, 100, 99, 100 in this way, right?\\nExecutive: Specifications are also fine, okay, right now where are you facing the major issue, which product is not visible to you?\\nCustomer: Six products are in inactive, so the ORB in it, I want to make it live, so activate it, so it is not happening, there it is showing product issue, but from my side I have done everything, I have checked it twice, its specifications are all correct.\\nExecutive: Product issue is coming, mainly that is the reason, I have told you, okay, that is what I am also seeing. One second.\\nExecutive: Have to edit it.\\nExecutive: Second, in this you have put the price, your product is 622 FPA, right?\\nCustomer: Haan.\\nExecutive: First, haan, so in this you have put the price, uh, \u20b920,590, okay, per piece.\\nCustomer: Okay.\\nExecutive: Haan, second if I talk about here, so here you have put its specifications and this is put.\\nExecutive: And inactive reason, one second I am properly checking it.\\nExecutive: Just a minute.\\nExecutive: So you have to active product, right?\\nCustomer: Yes.\\nExecutive: From your side see if it is getting active or not, do it once again.\\nCustomer: It is not happening, it is showing product issue.\\nExecutive: Not even now.\\nExecutive: Ma'am, just a minute.\\nExecutive: One minute, just check it, is it happening?\\nCustomer: One second.\\nExecutive: Happened from your side, what?\\nCustomer: You do it from your side, haan, I have done it from here, haan ji, haan ji, I have refreshed it from here, you do it from your side.\\nCustomer: Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, I will just do it a little.\\nExecutive: One minute, just a minute.\\nCustomer: Ma'am, when the products get removed.\\nCustomer: uska score kaise kam ho raha hai?\\nCustomer: 183.5\\nCustomer: Model number repeat karna na please uske sath bolta.\\nCustomer: Sir now it's alright.\\nCustomer: Hua, hua, hua, hua.\\nCustomer: Hello.\\nCustomer: Ho gaya.

So ma'am, ek kaam kariye, haan, suniye, usme edit kariye, ho sakta hai ki aapke rejection product issue ye hota hai ki agar aapke prices market se zyada high honge, is wajah se bhi reject ho jata hai. Second aapne koi photo jo, jo photo video isme jo bhi dala hua hai, aapne kisi aur profile se to utha ke nahi dala hai, Google se download kiya hai ya fir aapne apna original images me.\\nCustomer: Nahi, jis brand ka maine upload kiya hai na, uski brand ka link hai wo.
