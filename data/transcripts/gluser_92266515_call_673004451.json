You guys already know right when I registered my profile in the system, right? It given my I given my pin code and everything. When I told these guys, these guys said sir every day you are getting 20 30 request from your area within 30 kilometers 50 kilometers. So ek demo bhi diya. So they didn't show me the area and all that. So they close up the list of inquiries you are getting and all that.
