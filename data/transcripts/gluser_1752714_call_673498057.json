Instead of 36 month it will be 38 month sir.\\nCustomer: That but management is not accepting this.\\nExecutive: Sir but why sir because if you compare with the last year also, we are not even matching the last year costing sir. That we have done in 2022.\\nCustomer: Because you know you know all three years we don't have that much there is much quality of leads.\\nExecutive: Okay.
