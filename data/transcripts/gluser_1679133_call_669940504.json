  "transcript": "Hello?\\nCustomer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Sir, I was saying that the ticket that was opened, I was closing your concern, okay?\\nCustomer: Hello? Concern, which one? Okay, okay, you were talking about that.\\nExecutive: Okay, yes, yes, the ticket is open, sir. So, now this concern is closed. I will tell you, there was a conversation that happened after your phone call, I asked about the ticket.\\nCustomer: So, the main thing was that the person was a little upset that you had talked yesterday and then you are saying that you are mailing, but the mail has not come from your side. So, Naveen ji got a message that you have not made the payment. So, they said that we are waiting for your mail, that your mail comes, then we will do it. So, a little bit, but the main thing was that they were saying that there was a miscommunication.\\nExecutive: Miscommunication happened a little bit.\\nCustomer: A screenshot, one screenshot they gave me, they are saying to the sir\\nCustomer: That your last date is this thing. So, ma'am or sir, whoever was talking in the message, they said that, yes, I know the date. So, they are saying that if you knew, you would have done it on time. This means that the customer is a little bit like this.\\nExecutive: I understand sir, I understand.\\nCustomer: So, what happens is that everything, now see what happens, if you are talking to everyone so nicely, if someone comes in between and does that, then involvement.\\nExecutive: I understand, I am accepting that mistake has happened definitely. And see sir, if you are talking to me, okay, I am accepting that you are talking to me. Sir, my coordination with you is at least good, the terms I understand.\\nCustomer: Sir, I am also understanding your same situation, I am also in the same department. See, you are working for the company, I am also working for the company. But you can understand that we are also in sales, I am in sales, so I know that sometimes I mean sometimes in some company, I have to talk directly, sometimes I have to talk to the employee, but my point of view always remains that the person who is watching knows who I am talking to. You can understand, if you talk to me about something, then I might take it casually, but what happens is that the owners, they always pay attention to small things. You can understand that it is a habit that I am understanding sir, you don't need to explain, I am understanding that thing very well.\\nExecutive: They gave me screenshots, I will tell you, I have a message.\\nCustomer: They wrote this in the screenshot, like, wait a minute.\\nCustomer: Yes, uncle, this message was that, sir, multiple discussion is done here, final price shared by Himanshu, we have almost finalized any proposal, please confirm so that I can send final proposal.\\nCustomer: So, then they wrote that I know the, they wrote that I know the end date, please don't tell me again and again. So, then they were saying that the date is over, so then they wrote, Naveen ji wrote that if you know, you should have paid it before end date.\\nCustomer: So, but then, then it was that they started saying that, then sir wrote that we had told Himanshu ji to mail our last conversation, we are waiting for that. So, then what happens is that something happens, they feel a little bad or anything.\\nCustomer: So, this was the thing. So, a little bit, especially if I sit down, they are saying to me that you should not talk to Naveen ji, if their call comes, then don't talk to them. You talk to them, but see, I talk to you, before you, Harshita ma'am was there, maybe.\\nExecutive: Harshita ma'am.\\nCustomer: She was there, and Shalu ji, I have also talked to her. So, I said that it doesn't happen like this, see, talking to them, my customer, you, we meet in every way, in sales or here, so every customer has some issue sometimes, our product is like this, I sent some items, sometimes someone's item breaks, something like this goes away. So, customers become hyper, they say that you have sent a broken item or a bad item. So, everything has to be handled, but we also tell the customer that our work is going on. Yes, if someone is being rude, then we can say that, but no one is like that, everyone is sitting in business, so everyone.\\nExecutive: No, no sir, no, here, that is a different thing, sir, here it is not at all, here the thing is different.\\nCustomer: So, I am saying the same thing that now what happens is that if they tell me, then I take it casually, I say that we are talking, but now you see the person in front, they are sir, owner, so they must have felt that they are telling us those things, so that is why they themselves raised the ticket, I talked about all that, when you told me that the ticket was generated, what was the matter.\\nCustomer: So, I asked like this. So, they were saying many things that see, they are like this, like they are threatening that we will close your account, otherwise this is it. So, all those things were there. So, for this reason, sir was saying that I will put a request there that it should not be left like this. So, now let's see, the issue was the concern, now see, if someone else from the team calls you, then I have to tell them. So, I have told you too.\\nExecutive: Okay sir, but now everything is fine again, no problem. But for now, I will close it.\\nCustomer: If you close it, that's fine, but I want to say that if you are asked about it in the future, what was your concern?\\nExecutive: Yes, yes sir, definitely. It is being recorded.\\nCustomer: Naveen ji will be told that they have such a customer.\\nExecutive: Absolutely sir, absolutely will be told, absolutely will be told.\\nCustomer: Okay, okay, absolutely will be told. Okay, I am closing it for now, sir, you will get a mail, sir, so please satisfy mark it, it will be a review for me basically, okay sir? Because this ticket opens, so for a satisfaction, a request will go to you, it will be for me, not for Naveen sir, so I am telling you clearly.\\nCustomer: Okay, okay.\\nExecutive: Okay sir, okay.\\n",
