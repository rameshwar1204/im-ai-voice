  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Hello, hi sir, good evening.\\nCustomer: Good evening.\\nExecutive: Sir, Sumit baat kar raha hu sir.\\nCustomer: Yeah, Sumit.\\nExecutive: Haan, sir maine actually call isliye nahi kiya tha, maine socha sir thoda kabhi free honge to 5:30 baje tak, 5:20 tak karunga call aapko. Briefly bas maine call nahi kiya tha. Ji sir.\\nCustomer: [unintelligible]\\nExecutive: Ab aap bataye sir, actually jo hamari form chali hai album ke liye, aapko basically concern yahi hai na ki main jo deal karta hu 50-100 kilometer ke andar karta hu lekin mere paas jo queries vagera hai, leads vagera wo bahar ki area ki bhi mere ko visible hoti hai, mere area ki limited bahut kam aa rahi hai, Kurnool uske near by ki, right sir?\\nCustomer: Yeah.\\nExecutive: Exactly. Bilkul sir reason main wahi bata raha hu kyuki jo aapke products hai basically kyuki waha pe jo opportunities of enquiry hai wo bahut kam hai. Isi wajah se wo aapko waha pe nahi dikh rahi hai kyuki maine sari cheeze nikalwai bhi hai, check bhi kara hai.\\nCustomer: Sumit, understand what I'm saying. Before I got enrolled to this IndiaMART, it is you guys who promised me that sir Kurnool se bahut zyada aa raha hai. This is a good offer for you, take it up. Maine bola kaha aa raha hai, kuch bhi nahi aa raha hai mujhko. You guys shared a screen and you showed me sir dekh lo kitna aa raha hai, Kurnool se aa raha hai, idhar aa raha hai, udhar aa raha hai, aapke aa raha hai.\\nExecutive: Haan.\\nCustomer: Now the real fact is very simple Sumit again, I was telling like I told already 100 times but I'm repeating it again. Think for example there is an interlocking brick industry in Hyderabad too. Okay?\\nExecutive: Haan.\\nCustomer: Let's assume that guy is selling for \u20b940 a brick and I'm selling a brick for \u20b935. Though my brick is cheaper than that with a good quality, the minute I send through a transport from Kurnool to Hyderabad, the brick cost will become \u20b960.\\nExecutive: Exactly.\\nCustomer: Customer will pay for that?\\nExecutive: [unintelligible]\\nCustomer: Haan, customer will pay for that? He won't be paying for it. Right?\\nExecutive: Exactly.\\nCustomer: So, in the buylead mein, I'm getting 99% of the offers I'm getting from Hyderabad.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: Okay? There are one or 2% I'm getting from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and all that. Kya fayda karu yaar wo?\\nExecutive: Wo sir dekho wo suggested hum dikhate hai is wajah se. Ab aap bataye sir dekho mere paas to dekho do hi options hai. Dekho leads ki agar main baat karunga aapko, sir wo to dekho sir is tarike se yaani mere paas dekho dusra option hai ek wahi hai ki main sir aapki services ko close karake sir aapka jo bhi amount katta hai wo aapko wapas karwa deta hu. Main sir itne hi tarike se aapko help out karwa paunga. Jaisa aap kahenge.\\nCustomer: Yeah.\\nExecutive: Ji, ji. Let's go with that because it's been like three weeks. Ek lead bhi nahi aaya abhi tak.\\nCustomer: Hmm.\\nExecutive: Kyuki dekho main aapko bilkul frankly main aapko bilkul cheeze clear bata raha hu kyuki aisa na ho kyuki dekho same problem aapko rahegi kyuki area of enquiry jo generation ho raha hai leads mein wo bahut limited ho raha hai sir. Ye rahega ki sir jo aapko dikh raha hai.\\nCustomer: Exactly. You guys told me pehle se bol raha tha and you guys never left me. Since aapka team mujhe baar baar call kar raha tha and they promised me sir aa jayegi, aa jayegi within three months you will take your money back and all that. Isliye maine enroll kiya. But abhi tak ek lead bhi nahi aaya.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: Dekho sir leads se dekho sir leads to waha pe aayegi, leads se milegi lekin but area wo hai kyuki dikkat ye hai kyuki jo area of dealing hai aapka wo limited hai, right? To uske base pe kabhi enquiry waha pe generate hogi, kabhi nahi hogi.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: I can expand my area till America. I have no problem at all. But the problem is when comes for the pricing, it's transportation to aayega. Whether the customer will be happy to do it, nahi hai na. That's what I've been trying from day one.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: Wo to sir dekho.\\nCustomer: Aap logo ne kya bola tha? They bola sir sir government project aayegi, tender aayegi, wo pura aayegi sir you can take that, you can utilize it bola. Maine socha okay. Since you guys are promising such a repeated company bol raha hai, okay sun sun pata hu main pay kar diya. Right abhi tak ek bhi nahi aaya. Roz roz main buyleads try kar raha hu ek bhi nahi aaya. Nothing is relevant.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: Aur aata hai if I get something, 1000 ka aata hai, 2000 ka aata hai. 2000 mein mera profit kya hota hai? Not even a rupee.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: If it's a volume is big, I will make a profit. It's such small volume mein kuch bhi nahi aata hai.\\nExecutive: Bilkul. Ab dekho sir wahi hai mere paas wahi option hai dekho ki main aapki jo hai services ko close karake jo bhi aapka amount banta hai wo aapka main amount aapka refund karwa deta hu sir wahi ek option hai mere paas sir.\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's better Sumit. I'll go with that, yeah.\\nExecutive: Not an issue. Ab main ek baar aapki services ko yaha pe close karwa deta hu sir aur kal tak services ko jo bhi hai main close karwa ke phir main I'll just proceed further with the same sir.\\nCustomer: Thank you Sumit. Appreciate that.\\nExecutive: Okay, surely sir. Thank you sir. Thank you so much sir. Thank you. Bye.\\n",
