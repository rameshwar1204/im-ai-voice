  "transcript": "Customer: Hello?\\nExecutive: Ah, hello, Vinod sir, Nandakumar sir, I am calling from IndiaMART now.\\nCustomer: Tell me sir.\\nExecutive: Yes sir. Sir, that interaction was not going well between you and Sharan, that's why you are not satisfied.\\nCustomer: Sir, I am not saying anything bad about him. I am asking why the buyleads are fake. Why are your buyleads fake? All the allocated ones are fraud. Why is it coming like that, that's what I am asking.\\nExecutive: Okay.\\nCustomer: Sir, you are giving 40 leads per week, give me one lead, no problem. Give genuine leads, that's what I am asking.\\nExecutive: Okay sir, I will guide you through some things. Instead of guiding, I will tell you what better support I can provide from my side. And if it seems right to you, then just follow it. Okay? So first of all, IndiaMART, we are not just giving you buyleads, we are giving two types of enquiry sir. One is direct, they will say.\\nCustomer: Sir, direct is not a problem sir. Direct, if they ask, just enquiry, ask for price only. Price they are asking, no problem. I am giving. Buylead, if they are doing, lead comes, that is okay. Employees should not disturb anyone. Without asking, why are they torturing me, they are asking. Why are you giving that kind of lead to my customer?\\nExecutive: Understood, understood sir.\\nCustomer: Sir, one person is asking for 10 square feet, another is asking for 5 square feet, how are you allocating them? Is this a factory that I am running, tell me sir sir.\\nExecutive: Sir, we are not able to...\\nCustomer: Sir, 5 square feet, 5 square feet what? Its value is almost 300 rupees, why are you allocating that lead? I am buying one lead, paying 37 rupees, 40 rupees. Why are you allocating 300 rupees to me? Tell me, my time is getting wasted.\\nExecutive: Understood, understood sir. Next, I will give you a solution for this sir. Now, whatever you are doing, high value, high level, you are taking it like that, when it is like that.\\nCustomer: Sir, nothing, give me Dindigul enquiry, give Madurai enquiry, give Madurai, Theni enquiry. I am doing square leads, I am doing small TV work, fabrication work I am doing. Give me that kind of allocation, no problem.\\nCustomer: I am also manufacturing, I have a shop, no issue for me. Give me that kind of lead, no problem, I will use it.\\nExecutive: Okay sir, I will do it sir. Can we meet in a Google Meet tomorrow, you and I?\\nCustomer: Yes, morning around 10 o'clock I will call sir, 10:30 call me sir.\\nExecutive: Sure sir, I will connect. And now you have given that not satisfied, that interaction was not going well, complaint on Sharan, it is like that only.\\nCustomer: Sir, I am not complaining about him, first understand, first of all understand what I am saying. Why are they making me wait? Why are they cutting the call? After 5 minutes, they are nicely cutting the call, tell me sir.\\nExecutive: Understood, understood sir. Because my time is getting wasted sir.\\nExecutive: No no, that is correct sir. I will actually take action sir, definitely I will take it, if you ban him, I will take it. And what he did. Daily try, daily try, if I try, he is not picking up the phone. Why are they talking and cutting the call? Hold and cut, they are doing.\\nExecutive: That's it, understood, understood sir. Okay sir, I will do it sir. I will connect with you tomorrow around 10 o'clock. A little bit, 10 o'clock is 11 o'clock, it is okay for me. If you say okay, I will connect because I have another meeting scheduled at 10 o'clock.\\nCustomer: After 11 call me sir, after 11 to 11:30 call me sir.\\nExecutive: Sure sir, sure sir, we will connect. Whatever problem you have, we will discuss it in the video meet and I will give you a proper solution for it sir. Okay? So now you have given the complaint on him, it is not there, it is the anger on IndiaMART, correct?\\nCustomer: Sir, I am not personally complaining about him. I don't need to complain about him sir. Because it is interactions based, that's why the feedback has come to you on WhatsApp, that's why. So if you, if there is no this on him, then I can close the concern with your permission?\\nCustomer: I don't have any personal issue with him sir. Why should I complain about him? IndiaMART, what is going to happen if I complain about him? I am purchasing leads, if I purchase, fake leads are coming, that's why I am complaining, there is no other reason. What is going to happen if I do it on him, tell me. That is a commercial problem.\\nCustomer: Sir, everything is a problem sir. Enquiry, all enquiry, buylead, whatever is coming, everything. If it is coming in Tamil Nadu, everything is fake only.\\nExecutive: Hmm.\\nCustomer: Sir, that's what I am saying, if you assign 40 leads, weekly give me one lead, enough. Monthly four leads give, genuine lead give, that's all. I am buying, you are allocating, no problem, I am using it.\\nExecutive: Understood, sir. So for good quality leads, what to do, what work, what you have to see, you have to do maximum leads consumption, everything.\\nCustomer: Sir, keywords are not changing sir, all keywords are common sir. Keywords are common, Google search keywords are giving us.\\nExecutive: Sure.\\nCustomer: Keywords are not changing, everything. That all you should not release.\\nExecutive: Okay, okay. Okay sir. Tomorrow morning 11 o'clock call me sir, for me.\\nExecutive: Okay, 11 o'clock I will call, a little bit we will connect and we will see what is what sir. And now we both are talking, this interaction, you will get a mail sir. Feedback will come. That only little bit see. In case I have spoken anything wrong, you can put it in that place. I am believing that you will properly give feedback. Tomorrow morning 11 o'clock I will call. Little bit you, if it is finished, your employee one person is there, you told, right? Them also you are interacting, if you are doing, maximum 10 to 15 minutes sir. That 10 to 15 minutes. Sir, they will only call, they will not come on video call, they will only take the call. If you want, I will allocate them, I will tell them to talk on the phone.\\nExecutive: No, you also, you both come sir. Give only 10 minutes. It will definitely add some value to your company sir.\\nCustomer: Okay, morning call me sir.\\nExecutive: Sure, sure, sure sir. Okay sir, mail will come, that only little bit see. Thank you sir.\\nCustomer: Okay sir, thank you, thanks.\\n",
