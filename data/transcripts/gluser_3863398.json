  "transcript": "Customer: Hello.\\n\\nCustomer: Hello ma'am.\\n\\nExecutive: Hello.\\n\\nCustomer: Hello.\\n\\nExecutive: Hello, good evening ma'am. Deepika speaking from IndiaMART.\\n\\nCustomer: Ah.\\n\\nExecutive: Deepika ma'am, I am calling from IndiaMART.\\n\\nCustomer: Ah, yes ma'am, this is, I think you are calling to ask a doubt.\\n\\nCustomer: I had requested to call.\\n\\nExecutive: That's right, that's right. My number is there, right ma'am? You can call that, right?\\n\\nCustomer: If I call that, it, your call is not going through ma'am, it says wrong number.\\n\\nExecutive: Okay. Can you tell me your mobile number?\\n\\nCustomer: This office number, tell me. I called from my number before, it was the wrong number then too. Now when I call from the office number, it is the same.\\n\\nExecutive: Okay. That's right ma'am. Actually, what it is, is call my number. It mostly won't come like that, you try. Or WhatsApp text even, do that.\\n\\nCustomer: Call. Tell me ma'am, what is your doubt?\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am, work from home, they said. So, can't we scan by using, now we normally scan, can't we access from that, can't we see?\\n\\nExecutive: How ma'am? I don't understand what you are saying.\\n\\nCustomer: No, now the office, now the system is there, right?\\n\\nCustomer: From this, now if staff are working from home, now if they scan on the phone, can't they see like that?\\n\\nExecutive: Can do ma'am. In the mobile app, how we use it, are you talking about that?\\n\\nCustomer: That's why, now I, I saw, it wasn't there. So what I did was, I installed the app and put sir's number.\\n\\nExecutive: Okay ma'am. OTP will come only like that.\\n\\nCustomer: That's how to do it.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay ma'am. That's why, I did like that and opened it. Suppose this way, suddenly, that kind of situation, if it is not there, if we scan, is there anything like that, that's why I am asking.\\n\\nExecutive: No, no, no. Mostly what is here, is fully for business purposes, right ma'am? So, registered number means, one number will be there.\\n\\nExecutive: 921 ends, right? If you log in to any system or mobile, the verification will be sent to this number only. Almost this is a very important website. Someone should not misuse it.\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm.\\n\\nExecutive: In case if someone else, our competitor, if we scan easily and open, definitely there will be a lot of issues. That's why they have kept it like that. Do you have any other doubts ma'am?\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am. Now I have opened like that only, putting sir's number, getting OTP.\\n\\nExecutive: Okay ma'am.\\n\\nExecutive: That's how to do it ma'am. Otherwise it won't come. That's how we have to do it. First, I was asking that only, that's why I called. Because work from home, they told me to see. That's why.\\n\\nExecutive: Oh, you are doing like this, you have come live, like that ma'am?\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am, they told me to see from home.\\n\\nExecutive: To see from home? Oh okay. That's why. You can see. Same system using options will be there. Is that okay ma'am? In that, do I have to write anything?\\n\\nExecutive: I don't understand ma'am.\\n\\nCustomer: No, mobile, now mobile app, you are going to use, right? So in that, do I have to write anything? How to use it, like that?\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am. Now I, in the app, in that, in Chrome, it showed install app. I clicked install app and, that's it ma'am. In that, how to write the screen, I am asking.\\n\\nExecutive: No ma'am. I know how to use it ma'am. Because I am doing it from home, I asked like that. Is that option there, is it available, that's why I called. Because some options will be a little different.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay. For mobile also.\\n\\nCustomer: Now we have put a tag in this ma'am. Now if we have put a tag, now in which, where to see it? Now separately, in individual only, we have to go and see all the tags? Or where to see the tag?\\n\\nExecutive: Tell me ma'am, tag?\\n\\nCustomer: I don't understand.\\n\\nExecutive: No, tag, I don't understand. Products?\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am, now if we are talking to a customer, in that, label, label is there, right?\\n\\nExecutive: Label, yes.\\n\\nCustomer: Now if we have put the label.\\n\\nCustomer: Where is it?\\n\\nExecutive: Lead manager, open it.\\n\\nCustomer: I have opened it ma'am.\\n\\nExecutive: In that, above, more option is there?\\n\\nCustomer: Three lines.\\n\\nExecutive: No ma'am. More, one option will be there, see, panel symbol like that.\\n\\nCustomer: More option.\\n\\nCustomer: No ma'am, three lines are there.\\n\\nCustomer: Filter is there. Search is there in the middle. More option, filter is there, in that labels will be there, see.\\n\\nCustomer: Ah, it is there ma'am. Labels. If you click that, what all labels are there, it will show.\\n\\nCustomer: It is showing ma'am. Now if we click one and give apply, that thing only. Okay ma'am, like this. Fully we can search in this.\\n\\nCustomer: Ah, that only I was thinking, how to see it. Because so many labels we are giving. Now if I don't attend the call, call attend, we are putting. Then that thing, in old contacts, if we have to search and see, how to do it, that's it.\\n\\nExecutive: Okay ma'am. Is it clear?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah, now it is clear.\\n\\nExecutive: Ah, okay. So this is like a concern raised to us ma'am. Because you told customer care to call, right? That only I will receive. So can I close the concern?
