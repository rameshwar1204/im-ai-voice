  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hello.\nExecutive: Hello. Yes, Aditya ji.\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Yes, sir, tell me, you had called.\nCustomer: Yes, there was a talk about scheduling a meeting last week, but I couldn't talk that day, then I called back once, but you were busy, then you called on Monday, but I was out of station, so I said I'll call today.\nExecutive: Okay. So sir, tell me now, did you want to discuss something about the subscription?\nCustomer: No, who are you speaking, what's your name?\nExecutive: Ji, Nidhi speaking from IndiaMART. Am I talking to Aditya ji from Maheshwari Industries?\nCustomer: You can already see my subscription, right, Nidhi ji.\nExecutive: Yes, yes.\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Okay. You were the one who said that the catalog needs to be updated, so a one-week meeting has been scheduled, right?\nExecutive: Actually sir, that was your feedback meeting. You had newly onboarded, right, regarding that.\nCustomer: Yes, so you said that keywords etc. also need to be added to the product, what all needs to be done.\nExecutive: Yes, your entire catalog, like the products you are dealing in.\nCustomer: Yes, yes.\nExecutive: Hello. What type of, hello.\nCustomer: Yes, tell me.\nExecutive: So all those names that you know, all those names have to be added to your catalog so that buyers can see your profile.\nCustomer: Yes, you sent me a WhatsApp saying that all these names will be added to your product keywords etc.\nExecutive: Yes. So sir, now\nCustomer: Hello.\nExecutive: Now I will, hello, yes.\nCustomer: Yes, tell me.\nExecutive: I'll share the video meeting link by 4:00 PM, we can connect at that time, will you be free then?\nCustomer: Either do it tomorrow morning, madam, that would be better.\nExecutive: Tomorrow morning. Okay, fine. Sir, you have\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Didn't you have my number?\nCustomer: Yes, yes. I called on that too, but there was no reply.\nExecutive: Okay, actually I was in the washroom, that's why I didn't notice.\nCustomer: No problem, no problem.\nExecutive: Okay.\nCustomer: Yes, yes. So either I'll text you on WhatsApp around 11:00 AM tomorrow morning.\nExecutive: Hello.\nExecutive: Hello.\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Yes, so I'll schedule your meeting for 11:00 AM tomorrow morning, will that be suitable for you?\nCustomer: Tomorrow, yes, make it 11:30, I'll be आराम से (comfortably) in the factory, in the office by 11:30.\nExecutive: Okay, sure sir. And now, like you called customer care, so a concern has been opened in our system.\nCustomer: Okay, okay, okay. Yes, so I'll close it, sir. I'm closing it. The rest, we'll have the meeting tomorrow morning at 11:30. We'll talk in detail.\nCustomer: Okay, secondly, tell me one thing, hello. Your IndiaMART office in Guwahati.\nExecutive: Yes.\nCustomer: Can I get the contact number of any area manager or senior person there?\nExecutive: Sir, actually your case is in IndiaMART's headquarters. Noida sector 135.\nCustomer: Okay.\nExecutive: Yes. So the account manager you have, not mine, well, you are managing my account.\nExecutive: Yes.\nCustomer: My other concern was, the two sales guys who met me here, who finalized my deal.\nExecutive: Yes.\nCustomer: Yes, I want to file a complaint regarding their ethics.\nExecutive: Okay, you tell us sir, it will be done from our side.\nCustomer: No, I need to catch him too, because of that man, my integrity, my company has been questioned.\nExecutive: Okay, sir, what happened? Because your sales guy was.\nExecutive: Yes. When we finalized the package, we first said we'll take it for six months, they agreed to that. Then they said that the payment cannot be done in one time and we don't have an auto-debit system from our bank every month.\nExecutive: Okay. So when we converted to yearly, a month passed, and the price increased a bit.\nExecutive: Okay. So that guy came to my office, even talked in front of my boss, he said, no sir, I'll return ₹2000 in cash, it will be reduced from your subscription.\nExecutive: Okay, do you remember his name, sir?\nCustomer: Yes, his name is Dimbeshwar Saikia.\nExecutive: Okay, fine.\nCustomer: I did that, now what happened, he hasn't been picking up my phone for 15 days, no call back, there was a manager with him named Partho Pratim, he also came. That guy is also not picking up the phone, and now in my office, it has become that, hey, he said ₹2000 in front of me, so you must have taken it and eaten it.\nExecutive: Okay.\nCustomer: So I am not able to get in contact with anyone in the Guwahati office, can you give me anyone's number so that I can go and catch him, this is absolutely ridiculous, they have created such a big mess for such a small amount.\nExecutive: No, sir, wait a minute on the call, just let me confirm the name once, you tell me his name.\nCustomer: Yes, what?\nExecutive: Tell me the name.\nCustomer: Dimbeshwar Saikia.\nExecutive: Wait a second, sir, I'll do a video.\nCustomer: I don't know if he is there or not.\nExecutive: Okay, yes, he is your sales representative.\nCustomer: He is, there will be another one with him named Partho Pratim who is above him. Area manager.\nExecutive: Partho Pratim.\nCustomer: Right, right? Yes, yes. Yes, he also came along.\nCustomer: And he also talked about the subscription, he said Dimbeshwar has already talked to you, so whatever commission or whatever we get, we'll return ₹2000 in cash, we can't return it online. I mean, we can't reduce it from your online payment.\nCustomer: So I pitched this in my office and they all agreed, okay, no problem.\nExecutive: Okay, let me check their details once, then if we have any details, I'll initiate their details to you.\nCustomer: No, I already have their details, I have the contact number, but they are not responding. My point is, if you can give me the address of your Guwahati office or any area manager here, there must be someone above them who is the area manager.\nExecutive: Yes. Sir, if you can give me their contact number, I'll contact them and tell them to send them to my office and tell them in my office that no, we haven't given the money to him, I don't need the money now, I don't care, ₹2000 is not a big deal for me. But it should not raise a question on me, right?\nExecutive: Yes, sir.\nCustomer: That is the thing. If you don't want to give it, then don't give it, I don't need the money, but come and clear things in my office in front of my boss that yes, sir, we haven't given him the money. We won't be able to give it or whatever we have left IndiaMART or whatever we have done. Whatever the reason.\nExecutive: Yes. Yes. Yes, at least I don't like being answerable for such a small amount.\nExecutive: Yes, absolutely sir, if you have a problem, okay, you are a salaried person, you cannot afford, you said to get the work done, now you are not able to give it, then clearly say sir, I am not able to give it, the matter is over, I'll close the chapter. Why is it just pending, right?\nExecutive: Okay, sure sir, give me some time.\nCustomer: That's why I said, I don't want to file an official complaint right now.\nExecutive: Yes. If I need to, I'll do it later through a proper mail, but if I can get the number of any area manager or any other person who can contact them, so that I can at least close the matter, that's why I was telling you.\nExecutive: Okay, sure sir, I'll look into this issue, okay, I'll inform you if I get any information.\nCustomer: Contact number, see, the area manager or the sales head of Guwahati, you people will definitely get the number in the system. If you find any, just share the number with me, I'll go and talk to them.\nExecutive: Okay, sure sir, and now schedule my meeting for 11:30 tomorrow.\nExecutive: Yes, okay.\nExecutive: Okay, the rest, I'm seeing the ticket raised in customer care in the mail, please cancel it, I did it to contact you.\nExecutive: Okay, okay. Actually, whenever you need anything, if you message me on WhatsApp, I'll reply to it, actually I was in the washroom at that time, that's why I couldn't revert to you.\nCustomer: Okay, okay, okay.\nExecutive: Okay, the rest, I'll close this concern. Thank you.\nCustomer: Okay and if you get any contact number of sales in Guwahati, please give it to me, area manager.\nExecutive: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely sir, I'll look into this. Okay sir.",
