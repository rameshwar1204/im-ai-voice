  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hello?\nExecutive: Hello.\nCustomer: Hello? Ji, I'm speaking from Shree Ganesh Enterprises.\nExecutive: Ji, ji tell me.\nExecutive: Okay, I'm Pallavi speaking from IndiaMART.\nCustomer: Tell me.\nExecutive: Yes. Ma'am, how is the response coming on our IndiaMART queries and buyleads right now?\nCustomer: The response is okay madam, nothing great.\nExecutive: Response is okay. So I think ma'am you are using buyleads regularly, so I think buyers are meeting you through IndiaMART.\nCustomer: Buyers are meeting madam but buyers are either sometimes they are not ready to pay, there are some trust issues, that's all. Buyers are meeting, it's not like that.\nExecutive: Buyers are meeting right ma'am. Even today you have used four leads from this. You have used cashew nut's buylead from Jaipur. You have also talked to them, these Jaipur customers.\nCustomer: Yes, everyone has been talked to but it's not that all leads are converting.\nExecutive: Correct. Ma'am, I agree that every lead should convert, we also know that, but we know that if you use 17 leads in the whole week, then some conversion should come.\nCustomer: It's not necessary every week convert, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.\nExecutive: Yes yes. So ma'am, you have taken services from IndiaMART, so we just want to know that are you satisfied, the buyer you are meeting, after that the conversion is coming or you have more expectation. I want to know this.\nCustomer: Not completely satisfied but it's okay like that.\nExecutive: Okay you are you know 50% satisfied I can say right.\nCustomer: Yeah. Okay ma'am. So what all improvement you need from our side? You need any help or any correction in the catalog, any any changes in the you know product range, any photos to be updated. You have some new packaging. Anything you want to update in the catalog.\nCustomer: Photos photos are to be updated for a few products.\nExecutive: Okay.\nCustomer: And also I think when I get the notification of any buylead, the buylead will be at least one hour already. It won't be very new buylead I see when every time I get the notification it's not a very new buylead. That is there.\nExecutive: Okay so you wait for the notification or you are you know checking the I keep checking I keep checking that's why I was every time I keep checking it won't be like a few times will be like just 10 minutes ago that will be there but whenever I get the notification it won't be the recent one that's what I was saying.\nExecutive: So that's okay it's notification just to remind you that you have to check the buyleads every like every four to five hours you can check the fresh leads and just try to consume the lead where the timer timer is like six hours ago, 12 hours ago. If if the lead is mentioning that it's a two days old, three days old you know try not to you know consume that lead that old one.\nCustomer: Yeah old ones usually I don't consume unless until I feel I can try for few products otherwise I don't. I try to go with the ones which are like within four hours itself.\nExecutive: Okay. And do you know that when you consume the buylead 17 buylead is the limit you know. Do you have any requirement to upgrade the package so that we can increase your buylead limit.\nCustomer: No no no madam no not currently. From this package itself I'm not getting I am no I have to see improvement here only then I can go for further packaging.\nExecutive: Surely surely. I just wanted to know if you need some more buylead balance. This is just a normal question.\nCustomer: No buylead balance no madam. Buylead balance I can only go with when I get fully conversion from the current ones. I want to achieve that first only then I'll go for the additional buylead no.\nExecutive: Mam you need our help to update the images or you yourself will update the catalog.\nCustomer: I need I need help to update the update the images yes.\nExecutive: Okay mam. I'm sending you a WhatsApp message. I will say hi on your WhatsApp through the WhatsApp number. You can share me the images. We will upload the new images for the respective product.\nCustomer: Okay madam okay okay.\nExecutive: Okay mam any other help you need from our side?\nCustomer: No nothing nothing as such.\nExecutive: And the product changes the same mam cashew nut uncovered seeds.\nCustomer: Yeah products are the same just need updations that's it. You just need to update the images.\nExecutive: Okay okay. So okay mam I'm just sending you the hi message.\nCustomer: You just send the images okay. And mam you have got your request for the you know back call that you we want to take the feedback. So should I close the request?\nExecutive: Yeah you can close the request.\nExecutive: Okay no problem mam. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah.",
