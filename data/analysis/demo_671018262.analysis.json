  "transcript_en": "Caller: Hello, I'm calling regarding the leads I'm receiving. They are not relevant to my business at all. I sell industrial equipment, and I'm getting inquiries about clothing and household items. This is a waste of my time and money.\n\nAgent: I understand your concern. Can you provide me with your IndiaMART ID so I can look into your account?\n\nCaller: It's [IndiaMART ID].\n\nAgent: Thank you. Please allow me a moment to review your account details. Okay, I see here that your primary product category is indeed industrial equipment. I apologize for the irrelevant leads you've been receiving. It seems there might be an issue with the category-city targeting settings. I will escalate this to our technical team to investigate and rectify the problem. In the meantime, I will manually filter your leads for the next week to ensure you only receive relevant inquiries. Is that acceptable?\n\nCaller: That sounds good, but how long will it take for the technical team to fix the underlying issue?\n\nAgent: I will follow up with them and provide you with an update within 48 hours. I will also add a note to your account so that any agent who handles your case in the future is aware of the situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nCaller: No, that's all for now. Thank you.\n\nAgent: You're welcome. Have a good day.",
