  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hello Executive: Hello Customer: Yes, speak. Executive: Good evening, am I speaking with Faisal? Customer: No, what is it? Executive: Am I speaking with Bhumesh? Customer: Yes, Bhumesh. Executive: I'm Pankaj calling from IndiaMART head office, relationship manager. I just received feedback that you spoke with Visit and were not satisfied with the discussion. I'm calling to understand what the discussion was about and why you weren't satisfied, what the problem is that wasn't resolved in your account. Customer: I'm a little busy right now, call later. Executive: Was the conversation with you or someone else? Customer: It was with Faisal. Executive: Okay, okay, when can I speak with him? Customer: Tomorrow morning. Executive: Yes, sir. Customer: Tomorrow morning. Executive: Can I connect with him in half an hour or an hour? Customer: What is your name again? Executive: Pankaj. Customer: Just one minute, sir. I don't know why he wasn't satisfied. Executive: Is he nearby? Customer: Yes, one minute. Executive: Just one minute, I'll just talk to him, please let me speak to him. Customer: Hello Executive: Hello sir, good evening, how are you? Customer: Good evening, I'm fine, speak. Executive: I'm Pankaj calling from IndiaMART head office, relationship manager. You had a discussion with Visit today regarding some services, and we received feedback that you were not satisfied. That's why I called. Executive: Okay. Customer: The call didn't connect at the time he called, so I received a service request, and I mistakenly typed a message in it. That's all. Executive: You mistakenly marked it as 'not satisfied'? Customer: Not satisfied. Executive: Okay, that rating is actually for our employees, and it negatively impacts them. So, you're saying it was a mistake, there's no issue? I'll talk to him. Because this concern was raised again since you marked it as 'not satisfied,' I'm calling again because the complaint was raised for 'not satisfied.' I'm closing it again now. You'll receive an email, and through the email, it will say that you were satisfied after speaking with me, and we resolved your complaint. Because the system is taking it as a complaint. So, please mark it as 'satisfied' in the comments and mention that you mistakenly marked it as 'not satisfied.' And if you have any other problems, contact Visit. Customer: Okay, sir. Executive: Okay, thank you, sir, thank you so much for your time, sir. Customer: Thank you.",
