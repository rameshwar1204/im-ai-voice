  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hi, if you record your name and reason for calling, I'll see if this person is available.\nExecutive: Hello.\nCustomer: Ji.\nExecutive: Hello, hi sir, good morning. Sanjay is speaking from IndiaMART Noida head office.\nCustomer: Ji, what is the work from IndiaMART?\nExecutive: Ji, is this Aryan Decorators?\nCustomer: Ji, ji, ji.\nExecutive: Ji, actually sir, I am calling you because my backend team, who gives you the profile, Durgesh Kumar, mentioned you had an incoming call. Because we manage the profile, my team manages it from the backend. I am the branch head speaking. Any query regarding that?\nCustomer: The query is that leads are not coming properly. The work that should be happening is not happening. This problem has been occurring since before Diwali.\nExecutive: Hmm.\nCustomer: But it is not getting resolved.\nExecutive: Leads are not coming correctly, you are saying sir?\nCustomer: No.\nExecutive: Are you talking about a particular category or overall, sir?\nCustomer: I am talking overall, sir.\nExecutive: Please stay on the line, sir, I will check. Because I am online, are you also in front of the system?\nCustomer: No, no, I am on the phone right now.\nExecutive: Not on the system.\nCustomer: Stay on the line, sir.\nExecutive: Hmm.\nExecutive: Are you Aryan Gupta sir? No, I want to confirm.\nExecutive: Ji, ji.\nExecutive: You mainly deal in tea cup sets, glass pudding sets, glass bowls, right?\nCustomer: Ji, ji, ji.\nExecutive: Ceramic tea. Sir, regarding the leads you are currently consuming, first tell me about them. What is the feedback? Were these leads relevant or not? For example, if I talk about...\nCustomer: I spoke to them. I have sent them photos.\nExecutive: No, no, I am not talking about today.\nCustomer: Hmm hmm, tell me sir, what are you saying?\nCustomer: One was from Rajkot this morning.\nExecutive: Hmm hmm.\nCustomer: One was from Pratapgarh.\nExecutive: Rohit, the buyer, where was he from?\nCustomer: What?\nExecutive: Rohit, Mohammad Shahbaz, Shahdab, Rohit, Rohit, a buyer named Rohit.\nCustomer: Shahdab was from Pratapgarh.\nExecutive: Okay, what happened? Did you send them a quotation?\nCustomer: Yes, I sent them photos just now.\nExecutive: Okay. And Balda, a buyer named Vishwas, Balda Vishwas.\nCustomer: Yes, he was from Rajkot.\nExecutive: Did you talk to them?\nCustomer: Rajesh bhai, yes. I sent him photos too.\nExecutive: Okay, you mean you sent photos for today's quotations?\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: And were you working yesterday? I can see that no lead was consumed yesterday, even though leads were available on the platform.\nCustomer: No lead was consumed yesterday, it was Sunday. I am not active on Sundays.\nExecutive: It was not Sunday, sir, it was Monday.\nCustomer: So, are you guys off on Mondays?\nCustomer: I was out yesterday. I was out and also off, but I was out, sir.\nExecutive: And the day before yesterday?\nCustomer: No, not the day before yesterday either.\nExecutive: Sir, actually I have opened both charts. I got the information quickly on the phone. I have opened both charts in front of me. Which leads came, how many are left, what is correct, what is not. Please confirm about yesterday first, so I can check the relevancy.\nExecutive: A lead came from Aurangabad regarding a cup gift set. You deal in that, right?\nCustomer: Today, today...\nExecutive: It came today. I don't have a problem with the category. My problem is with the quantity. Someone is asking for 20 sets, someone is asking for 50 sets.\nExecutive: What is the minimum you deal with?\nCustomer: Quantity is not working out. It should be at least 500 sets, at least worth 1.5 lakh.\nExecutive: You are talking about 500 sets?\nCustomer: Minimum I am telling you.\nExecutive: Ji.\nExecutive: Another lead came from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, regarding tea cup ceramic, 10,000 pieces. It was an order worth 10 lakh. This was today's lead.\nCustomer: [inaudible]\nExecutive: It came two hours ago, but I don't know, it is showing as expired now. Two hours ago. If I talk about today, two leads have come so far. You have consumed three. And two more have come, 10,000 pieces, which is good according to what you are saying. And...\nCustomer: Where did it come? I can't see the 10,000 one.\nExecutive: Do you have a laptop?\nCustomer: No, I don't have a laptop right now.\nExecutive: You don't use a laptop? You only use a mobile phone? I am asking in a generic way, do you use a mobile phone or a laptop?\nCustomer: I use a mobile phone. I open the laptop in the morning and evening.\nExecutive: Okay, okay, because it is not on the mobile phone. It was sold out. It came two hours ago. And if I check yesterday's data, you are online right now, no problem. Yesterday also, many leads came in the range of 500 pieces. For example, a lead came from Mumbai regarding vacuum glass. Okay? 10,000 what came?\nCustomer: What?\nExecutive: Vacuum, the lead is expired, but I am checking if it is coming or not. Vacuum glass, I don't deal in vacuum glass.\nCustomer: Vacuum glass is two cups gift set.\nExecutive: You don't do vacuum glass?\nExecutive: You don't do that? You do gifting items. Gifting items also came.\nCustomer: I do that, I do that.\nExecutive: This is a requirement of 500 pieces. I can see big ones. A white ceramic printed tea cup came. This is also good. This is also 500 pieces. Another one came. I can see that leads are coming quantity-wise. You are consuming some, but some are left on your profile.\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: I can only see the latest two days' data. According to me, the last two days' data shows that you have not worked. Quantity is coming, but you need to do one thing. Why are these leads being sold out?\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: What is the reason?\nCustomer: I am not available at that time, that's why they are being sold out.\nExecutive: You are not available. If five suppliers click and use the lead, it will be sold out. You need to look into this. I will keep it under observation. I will see how many expired, how many you consumed for a week. After a week, I will see how many expired are relevant. Okay? Voice is breaking. We can judge. Okay? Hello. One last thing, do you deal in glass jugs?\nCustomer: I am not dealing in glass jugs right now. I used to, but it is not in stock.\nExecutive: Glass tumbler, glass jug, glass jug?\nCustomer: I don't deal in glass jugs.\nExecutive: You deal in glass tumblers?\nCustomer: I do deal in glass tumblers.\nExecutive: You do, right? You are marking this category as negative.\nCustomer: No, glass tumbler, what is the lead? Tell me properly.\nExecutive: We check the category. Which categories have you marked as negative? You have marked glass tumbler. Lemon set is also marked.\nCustomer: Glass lemon set is also marked negative?\nExecutive: Yes. If you want to recover it, it must be marked negative due to low order quantity.\nCustomer: Mark it on quantity, not on the product.\nCustomer: That's wrong. I do lemon sets.\nExecutive: If you want to recover it, you need to go to the settings option in your system. In the settings option, the first option is the business preferences page. At the bottom, there is an option for non-preferred categories. You need to restore the categories you have marked negative from there.\nCustomer: Can you do it from your end?\nExecutive: I cannot do it from my end. Only the client can do it. You have access, I don't have access. I can only see the categories, I cannot do it. Only the client can do it.\nCustomer: Okay, I will do it.\nExecutive: That's it, sir. We will observe the quantity and leads. Just try to reduce the frequency of leads being left. Okay?\nExecutive: Aryan sir, this is my number. If you need any help, Durgesh from the backend, 3481 is the last number.\nExecutive: 3481. Branch head is speaking. Manager. Can you hear me?\nCustomer: Voice is breaking. Hello.\nExecutive: Can you hear me now?\nCustomer: Yes, is 3481 your last number?\nExecutive: Yes, yes, yes. My name is Sanjay.\nCustomer: Okay, okay.\nExecutive: Okay? I am the branch head. If you have any problems, you can call back directly during official hours. Okay, okay. Okay, thank you. I am processing your feedback for further closure. Okay, okay. Okay, thank you.",
