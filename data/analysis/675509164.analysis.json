  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hello\nExecutive: Hello\nCustomer: Yes\nExecutive: Sir, I have taken your paid service under the name Vraj consultancy.\nCustomer: Yes, tell me sir, good afternoon.\nExecutive: Good afternoon.\nExecutive: Yes sir.\nCustomer: I want to cancel that package and get a refund.\nExecutive: You want to cancel it? When did you take it?\nCustomer: It's been about a week.\nExecutive: Just a moment, I just came back from lunch. Give me some time, I will check and call you back at 3 pm, sir. Okay?\nCustomer: Okay, cancel it. I am not getting leads relevant to my service. I sit on the system all day.\nExecutive: Okay.\nExecutive: I will check it once because it might not be a problem. I will get the catalog checked.\nCustomer: Cancel it, sir. I don't want to work with you. Refund it.\nExecutive: Sir, there is no refund. That's why I am saying, let me check it once. Give me some time.\nCustomer: I got looted the first time. I will be careful from next time. I got looted once. Be careful from next time. What do you want to say?\nExecutive: Sir, I want to tell you one thing. If IndiaMART has been in the market for 30 years and lakhs of suppliers are connected, then it's not like everyone is getting looted.\nCustomer: People are connected in products, they stay connected in products. We are providing a service. There are many service providers here, not just thousands but lakhs. I am not getting a single inquiry. We can give you any time of the day. Your daily inquiry is going to waste.\nExecutive: Sir, will you give me a chance to check, please?\nCustomer: Yes, I will.\nExecutive: Because I am not exactly on the system right now, sir. I am on lunch. Our lunch is from 2 to 3. That's why I am saying, I will go to the system at 3 pm and call you. If you call from the front, I will call myself, sir. I will get it done by your account manager. I will do it myself. You don't have to worry about it. You don't need to call. The call will be from here, sir.\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Please don't worry, sir. I am getting it checked.\nCustomer: Sir, business is not coming, inquiry is not coming. If there is an inquiry, we will click on it.\nExecutive: I understand, sir. It might be that the catalog... Give me some time, sir. I will clear all your doubts. I am not going to say anything wrong to you, sir. It's not like I am asking for money, sir. I am saying regarding the service that if there is any scope for improvement.\nCustomer: Sir, tell the truth. The money is gone for a year.\nExecutive: Sir, tell me one thing. Like you complained to customer care today, okay?\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Did you talk to your account manager?\nCustomer: No.\nExecutive: Sir, you should have done this first. Have you ever talked to your account manager?\nCustomer: Yes, they called once or twice and said that I told them yesterday that I am not free today, I will explain tomorrow. So, he said that I will call you from the front tomorrow, but nothing has come yet.\nExecutive: No problem, I will get it checked and done, sir. Don't panic, sir. It doesn't happen like that. All your problems will be resolved, sir. Please don't worry, sir.\nCustomer: Inquiry, sir, inquiry is not generated. You will generate fake inquiry now.\nExecutive: What, sir?\nCustomer: The problem is that inquiry is not coming. I am not saying that work is not happening, we are not working. If inquiry is not coming, then will you generate fake inquiry now?\nExecutive: What did I say? There will be some shortcomings, categories are not added. I didn't say that I will generate fake inquiry for you.\nExecutive: I have told you five times, sir. What did I tell you five times? I am on lunch. There is no system in front of me, so I cannot check and tell you, sir. Give me time until 3 pm. I am getting it checked and calling you. I will resolve everything at that time. Then you are saying the same thing, sir. How can I help you now? I don't have a computer in front of me, sir. So, please give me an hour.\nCustomer: Okay, okay sir.\nExecutive: Yes sir, thank you sir.",
