  "transcript_en": "Customer: Hello.\nExecutive: Good afternoon sir, I am calling from IndiaMART. My name is Ankita. Am I speaking with Shree Balaji Metal?\nCustomer: Yes, speak.\nExecutive: Sir, you raised a query regarding a buylead for S S three hundred four pipe.\nCustomer: Yes, yes.\nExecutive: Sir, can you tell me the buylead ID?\nCustomer: Yes, write it down. Two three zero eight two five zero zero zero zero one.\nExecutive: Okay. Two three zero eight two five, five times zero, one. This buylead is for S S three hundred four pipe, right sir?\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Okay. Sir, for verification, please confirm your company name, Shree Balaji Metal?\nCustomer: Shree Balaji Metal, yes.\nExecutive: And your registered mobile number is the one you are speaking from?\nCustomer: Yes.\nExecutive: Okay. Sir, I can see that this buylead is from Sanjay Kumar ji, S K Enterprises, Delhi.\nCustomer: Is he a paid member or a free member?\nExecutive: Sir, one minute, let me check. Sir, he is a free member.\nCustomer: So madam, being a paid member, why are you giving us leads from free members? We want leads from paid members.\nExecutive: Sir, see, on IndiaMART, there are both paid and free buyers. The lead that we provide you is given based on the genuineness of the requirement. The buyer's requirement is genuine.\nCustomer: No, madam, we are paying money, so we should only get leads from paid members.\nExecutive: Sir, I understand your point, but the system does not work that way. The system forwards leads based on the requirement, not on the buyer's membership status. And sir, they also have TrustSeal.\nCustomer: What is this TrustSeal?\nExecutive: Sir, TrustSeal means that the buyer has verified their company documents, such as GST, PAN card, etc., with IndiaMART. This increases their credibility.\nCustomer: Okay, but we want business. We only want to deal with paid members.\nExecutive: Sir, please try contacting them once. The requirement is absolutely genuine. Maybe your deal will be finalized.\nCustomer: Can you guarantee that he will buy the goods?\nExecutive: Sir, I cannot guarantee the purchase. It depends on the negotiation between you and the buyer. Our job is to connect you with genuine buyers.\nCustomer: Hmm, okay. Alright.\nExecutive: Can I help you with anything else, sir?\nCustomer: No, that's all.\nExecutive: Thank you for calling IndiaMART. Have a good day.\nCustomer: Okay.",
