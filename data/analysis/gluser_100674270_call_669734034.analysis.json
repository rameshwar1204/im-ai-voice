Sir, you had a call, sir, incoming, which we can see here. So, because the profile, we manage it, meaning my team manages it on the backend. I'm the branch head speaking. Any query regarding that, any...\nCustomer: The query is that leads are not coming properly, the work that should be happening is not happening. This problem has been coming since before Diwali.\nExecutive: Hmm.\nCustomer: But it's not getting solved.\nExecutive: Leads are not coming correctly, you're saying sir?\nCustomer: No.\nExecutive: Are you talking about a particular category, sir, or overall?\nCustomer: I'm talking overall, sir.\nExecutive: One moment sir, let me check. Because I'm online, are you also in front of the system?\nCustomer: No, no, I'm on the phone right now.\nExecutive: Not on the system.\nCustomer: One moment sir.\nExecutive: Hmm.\nCustomer: Are you Aryan Gupta sir?

Sir, regarding the leads you are consuming right now, first tell me about that, because I opened this first. What is the feedback on the latest leads you consumed? Were these leads relevant or not, sir? Like if I talk about...\nCustomer: It happened, we talked. I have sent them photos now.\nExecutive: No, no, I'm not talking about today. Today...\nCustomer: Hmm hmm, tell me sir, what are you saying?\nCustomer: One was from Rajkot this morning.\nExecutive: Hmm hmm.\nCustomer: One was from Pratapgarh.\nExecutive: Rohit, the buyer, where was he from?\nCustomer: What?\nExecutive: Rohit, there was a buyer named Rohit, Mohammad Shahbaz, Shahdab, Rohit, Rohit.\nCustomer: Shahdab was from, what's the name, Pratapgarh.\nExecutive: Okay, what happened?

And there was a buyer named Balda, Vishwas, Balda Vishwas.\nCustomer: Yes, he was from Rajkot.\nExecutive: Did you talk to them?\nCustomer: Rajesh bhai, yes, he was there. I sent him photos too.\nExecutive: Okay, you mean you sent photos for today's quotation?\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: And were you working on it yesterday or what? Yesterday, sir, I can see that no lead was consumed. While the lead has already come on your platform.\nCustomer: No lead was consumed yesterday, it was Sunday, right? I'm not active on Sundays.\nExecutive: It wasn't Sunday, sir, it was Monday.\nCustomer: Meaning, is Monday off for you people?\nCustomer: Yesterday I was out. I was out, and it's off too, but I was out sir.\nExecutive: And the day before yesterday too?\nCustomer: Yes, the day before yesterday too.\nExecutive: Sir, actually I have opened both charts, I got it on the phone so quickly. I mean, I have opened both charts in front of me. Which lead came, how many are left, what is right, what is not. Please confirm yesterday's one, so that I can check your relevancy first. So, a lead came from Aurangabad regarding cup gift sets, sir. You do it, sir.\nCustomer: Today, today...\nExecutive: This came today. I don't have a problem with the category. The problem is with the quantity. Someone is asking for 20 sets, someone is asking for 50 sets.\nExecutive: What is the minimum you deal with?\nCustomer: Quantity is not happening. Minimum 500 sets should be there, at least goods worth 1.5 lakh.\nExecutive: You are talking about 500 sets, right?\nCustomer: I'm telling you the minimum.\nExecutive: Ji.\nExecutive: Another one came, sir, tea cup ceramic from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, it was for 10,000 pieces. It was an order worth 10 lakhs. This was today's lead.\nCustomer: [inaudible]\nExecutive: It came two hours ago, but I don't know, it shows the lead expired two hours ago. Two hours ago. If I talk about today, two leads have come so far. You have consumed three. And two more have come, one for 10,000 pieces, which was good according to me, which is better than this. And...\nCustomer: Where did it come? I can't see the one for 10,000.\nExecutive: Do you have a laptop?\nCustomer: No, I don't have a laptop right now.\nExecutive: You don't use a laptop? Meaning, only from mobile, right now, I don't have it right now. I'm out, I don't have it right now.\nExecutive: No, no, I'm just asking in a generic way, meaning do you use it from mobile or do you have a laptop too?\nCustomer: I use it from mobile. With a laptop, I open it in the morning and evening.\nExecutive: Okay, okay, because it's not on mobile. It won't show on mobile, it was sold out. But it came two hours ago. And if I check yesterday's data too, sir, you are online right now, there is no problem. Yesterday too, many leads came which were in the range of 500 pieces, as you are saying. Meaning, if I talk about a vacuum glass lead came from Mumbai. Okay? 10,000 what what related came?\nCustomer: What?\nExecutive: Vacuum, meaning this is an expired lead, but as much data as I am seeing, whether it is coming or not, sir. Vacuum glass, vacuum glass I don't do.\nCustomer: Vacuum glass is two cups gift set.\nExecutive: You don't do vacuum glass.\nExecutive: You don't do it in this? You do it in gift items. Meaning, gifting items have also come.\nCustomer: I do that, I do that.\nExecutive: This requirement has come for 500 pieces. The big ones I am seeing in this. One has come regarding white ceramic printed tea cups. This is also good. This has also come for 500 pieces. One more has come. Meaning, as much as I am seeing, sir, leads are coming quantity wise too, it's not like that. You are consuming it too, but some are left in your profile.\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: Because I can only see the latest two days' data, sir, meaning only the latest. Meaning, what is the point of checking the old one. So, according to me, sir, it's not like that. The two days' data is showing that you haven't worked. Otherwise, quantity is coming, sir, but you definitely have to do one thing in this. Why is this lead getting sold out?\nCustomer: Hmm.\nExecutive: What is the reason for this?\nCustomer: I won't be available at that time, that's why it's getting sold out.\nExecutive: Meaning, you are not available. Meaning, you are not available at that time. If your five suppliers click and use this lead, that lead will be sold out to you. You have to look into this a little bit. Otherwise, I will see it under observation. I will also see, sir, how many expired in a week, how many you consumed. Hmm. After a week, I will see, sir. How many expired are relevant. Okay? Voice is breaking. Actually, we will be able to judge. Okay? Hello. One last thing, sir, do you deal in glass jugs?\nCustomer: I am not dealing in glass jugs right now. I used to, but I don't have it in stock right now.\nExecutive: Glass tumbler, glass jug, in glass jug?\nCustomer: I don't deal in glass jugs.\nExecutive: Do you deal in glass tumblers?\nCustomer: I do deal in glass tumblers.\nExecutive: You do, right? You are marking this category as negative, sir.\nCustomer: No, glass tumbler, what is the lead actually? Tell me properly.\nExecutive: Not the lead, sir, we check the category. Which categories have you marked as negative. So, you have marked glass tumblers like that. You have marked lemon sets.\nCustomer: Glass lemon set is also marked negative?\nExecutive: Yes. If you want to recover it, low order, low order, it must be marked negative because of low order quantity.\nCustomer: Mark it on quantity, sir, you have marked it on the product.\nCustomer: It's wrong. I do lemon sets.\nExecutive: It's wrong. So, if you want to recover it again, okay?\nCustomer: You have to go to the settings option on your system. Hmm. The business preferences page comes at the top of the settings option. Okay? Hmm. At the bottom, there is an option called non-preferred categories. There, you have to restore the categories that you have marked negative from there.\nCustomer: You do it from your end.\nExecutive: It won't happen from my end, sir, only the client can do it. You people have access, I don't have access. I can only show these categories, I can see them, I can't do it. Only the client can do it.\nCustomer: Okay, I will do it.\nExecutive: That's all, sir. Otherwise, we will observe your quantity and leads, sir, meaning the frequency. But just try to reduce the frequency of the ones that are left. Okay?\nExecutive: Otherwise, Aryan sir, this is my number. If in case you feel you need some help, okay? I'm from the backend, Durgesh 3481 at the end.\nExecutive: 3481. Branch head is speaking. Manager. Can you hear the voice?\nCustomer: Voice is breaking. Hello.\nExecutive: Can you hear me now?\nCustomer: Yes, this is 3481, right, at the end?\nExecutive: Yes, yes, yes.
